I've done this several times going from larger HDD to smaller SSD and I wound up with a bootable SSD drive. One step you have to remember not to skip is to use Disk Utility to partition the SSD as GUID partition scheme HFS+ before doing the clone. If it came Apple Partition Scheme, even if you let CCC do the clone, the resulting drive won't be bootable. CCC usually works in \"file mode\" and it can easily copy a larger drive (that's mostly empty) onto a smaller drive. If you tell CCC to clone a drive you did NOT boot from, it can work in block copy mode where the destination drive must be the same size or larger than the drive you are cloning from (if I recall).\nI've actually done this somehow on Disk Utility several times (booting from a different drive (or even the dvd) so not running disk utility from the drive your cloning) and had it work just fine from larger to smaller bootable clone. Definitely format the drive cloning to first, as bootable Apple etc..\nThanks for pointing this out. My only experience using DU to go larger to smaller was when I was trying to make a Lion install stick and I was unable to restore InstallESD.dmg to a 4 GB USB stick but of course the reason that wouldn't fit is there was slightly more than 4 GB of data."}

The company is opting instead to add $3 billion to its stock-buyback program.\nWith the deal breaking up, Sysco will pay a $300 million termination fee to US Foods and a $12.5 million fee to Performance Food Group, which had agreed to buy some US Foods facilities. Sysco, based in Houston, plans to make the share repurchases over the next two years.\nRosemont, Illinois-based US Foods operates a major distribution center in Fishers. Sysco has a large warehouse at 4000 W. 62nd St., in Indianapolis.\nSysco had fought for more than a year to gain government approval for the transaction, which antitrust regulators said would hurt competition and lead to higher prices. Sysco and US Foods dominate a market known as broadline foodservice, which supplies school cafeterias, restaurants and hotels. Sysco had argued that the acquisition would bring $1 billion in savings, letting it offer lower prices to customers.\nInvestors have responded with relief to the deal\u2019s demise, reflecting concerns about the company undertaking an ambitious merger.

{"doc_id": "15", "text": "\"Bake me a pie or go away,\" I've literally had my son say that to me a few times. So, what was I to do except fulfilling his demand? Baking (not only pies), is a cooking method where tools DO actually make the man, which means that it is very hard or nearly impossible to do it successfully without proper bakeware.\nWith years of experience under my belt, I\u2019ve learned about and discovered what truly matters when looking for bakeware to buy, and I am going to teach you later in the article.\nAlso, I have reviewed what I believe to be the best five non-stick bakeware sets out there, so make sure to check them out if you are in search of one.\nThe first and most obvious reason is \u2013 because food doesn\u2019t stick to it! I do not want to sound overly simplistic, but any chef (or mom, as a matter of fact) knows that pans that stick will absolutely mess up the outcome.\nPeople normally solve this problem by oiling up, but I don\u2019t like it since it makes the food greasy. Using non-stick bakeware is a healthier, more convenient, and more practical way of baking.\nThe next thing that you might not have known is that non-stick bakeware is so much easier to clean than more conventional types. It is a no-brainer really \u2013 if nothing sticks to the surface then there won\u2019t be anything to scrub, scrape or wash off.\nThis trait right here will save you tons of time as well as frustration, and it might motivate you to bake more often because of the hassle-free cleaning process. Just make sure to maintain the bakeware.\n\u200bLastly, even heat distribution is another thing that you should look for, and this type of bakeware enables it.\nHere's the deal: heat distribution most likely won't affect the quality of the result, but it will make the bakeware heat up more quickly which will ultimately decrease the cooking time.\nInvesting a little bit of time into research can save you a lot of money and trouble in the long run, and that is why you need to read this section carefully.\nBakeware sets differ regarding materials, abilities, cost, and maintenance, so learning about some general features of these products will help you decide which type will fulfill your demands.\nBakeware can be made from different kinds of materials including iron, glass, copper, steel, etc.\nToday I will mention only the types that are related to products I reviewed in this article.\nIt is important to know that each material yields different cooking properties so study these paragraphs to find out which one is right for you.\nCarbon steel \u2013 this material is light, durable, and reacts to temperature changes very quickly, meaning that it can heat up fast. Even though is lightweight, it is a bit heavier than copper and doesn't retain heat as well as iron. It's a good choice for baking meats, veggies, bread, and cakes.\nCopper \u2013 it is an excellent heat conductor and doesn\u2019t need pre-heating since it gets hot very quickly. Very light, but also quite expensive compared to other bakeware materials. Also, it isn\u2019t the best choice for recipes that require baking under very high heat.\nSilicon \u2013 good for foods where sticking is an issue, such as breads, cookies, and cakes. It is light, affordable and dishes will slide out of it easily. The one downside is that it can be frustrating to wash because it is so elastic, but luckily, most of the silicon bakeware is dishwasher safe.\nSince you\u2019ll be buying an entire set of products, it would be a good idea to find one that is suitable for all kinds of baking jobs. Make sure that all the basic items such as pie pan, muffin pan, loaf pan, cookie sheet, cake pan, or whatever you need, is included in the package.\nThis is a feature that most folks overlook, and it makes a world of difference when it comes to handling the pan. It's easy to move the dish around when it's cold but taking it out of a scorching hot oven is a different story (trust me, I know). You\u2019ll try to be cautious not to burn your fingers so it is easy not to pay attention to the contents of the pan which can lead to spillage and a messy kitchen.\nLook for bakeware that has nice, ergonomic handles or handling areas. Some models have silicon added to these parts for extra protection and ease of use.\nNot all types of bakeware can withstand the same temperatures; as a matter of fact, this trait greatly differs from product to product. Certain pans are oven safe to up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit, while others cannot take more than 350.\nThis is a significant difference so pay close attention to this detail when buying a set.\nNow, let\u2019s get into the meaty part of this article \u2013 the reviews.\nAfter trying out many sets, I\u2019ve reached some conclusions and decided to put together a list of my favorite ones.\nKeep in mind that these are my personal choices, but they are also top rated products.\nRachel Ray is a world-renowned chef and TV personality, and her famous Cucina line of products never fails to deliver. Here, we are dealing with an excellent, 10-piece set that I personally think very highly of.\nThe material that this bakeware is made of is carbon steel, and the non-stick, latte-colored coating looks very pretty and does the job well.\nA thing that I didn\u2019t like about the construction of this set is that everything is so bulky. It is not a huge issue, but folks who lack storage space will not be thrilled with these products.\nAs far as items are concerned, the set includes two loaf pans, two cake pans, two cookie sheets, two pie plates, a muffin tin, and a plastic cake pan topper.\nIn my opinion, this is more than enough, but I\u2019m sure some folks are going to be disappointed because there\u2019s no pizza pan included.\nThe handles have silicon grips attached to them, and this is a big bonus when it comes to practicality and handling. Also, the rolled edges allow you to grab the pan more easily and move it around securely.\nThe pan can withstand heat of up to 450 F, and I think that this should be sufficient for most baking jobs. Make sure not to go over this temperature because you could burn the pans.\nCopper has gained a lot of popularity in the cooking world over the last few years, and honestly, I can only say good things about it. Copper Chef is known for a plethora of cookware, and now we are taking a look at their baking set.\nAs I've mentioned before, copper is a fantastic heat conductor, and the heat distribution in this material is as even as it gets.\nPersonally, I find the latter feature very important because I like to have consistency in my cooking.\nThis is a 12-piece set that consists of a 12-cup muffin pan, a cookie sheet, a loaf pan, a square pan, and eight pieces of silicon ramekin cups with lids.\nOk, so I think it is a bit unfair for a company to advertise a set of twelve copper products while only four of them are actually made of this material. While the ramekin cups are lovely, they seem to be a cheap filler in this set.\nAs far as handling is concerned, most of the products in this pack do not have handles, so you have to rely on the rolled edges for gripping. This is a big disadvantage in my opinion, and greatly handicaps the ease of use.\nThese black, sturdy-looking baking dishes remind me of old-school bakeware sets that people used to bake with a few decades ago. However, this is a modern and versatile set that should fulfill most of your demands.\nThe ChefLand set is made of carbon steel; it looks pretty plain but has a non-stick coating that's quite effective. One thing that this material is good at is even heat distribution, so you won\u2019t need to worry about hotspots.\nThe products are dishwasher safe, however, after several months of kind of cleaning, some items started to form rust on the outer edges, which is a big minus. I would recommend washing them by hand.\nWhen it comes to the items, ChefLand\u2019s set includes a roasting pan, a round pizza pan, a large and medium cookie sheet, two round cake pans, a square cake pan, a loaf pan, an oven crisper pan, and a 12-cup muffin pan. As far as I\u2019m concerned this set has everything covered!\nMost of the dishes have handles on them, and even those which don't, have a nice grip area that allows for good handling.\nUnfortunately, there is no silicon padding or protective surface so you will need to use gloves or cloth.\nThis bakeware set comes to us from Sunbeam; it is a bit smaller set in terms of the number of items in it, but a worthy addition to today's list. Oh, I forgot to mention it\u2019s cheap as chips!\nThe material these pans are made of is carbon steel, and its non-stick features are achieved with a xylan coating interior and exterior. The black color gives it a pretty plain, non-exciting look, but I personally do not mind this.\nThe Sunbeam set has only 5-pieces, which is significantly less than other sets we reviewed today. The dishes included are a loaf pan, a cookie sheet, a 6-cup muffin pan, and two round cake pans.\nOne disadvantage of this set is that it cannot handle temperatures higher than 400 F, which is quite limiting because some recipes require more heat.\nAll of the pans have handles or enough room to grab them properly and handle safely.\nNow as I was reading some online commentary, many people complained that pans arrived dented or bent when they ordered them, so this might be an issue.\nI haven\u2019t experienced this myself, so I just want to put it out as a warning.\nThis set differs from others I reviewed today because it is the only one that\u2019s not made of metal.\nBoxiki Kitchen brings us this 3-piece silicone set that bread and cake lovers might find interesting.\nAs I\u2019ve said, these products are made of silicone which has its pros and cons.\nThe good thing is that food will just slide out of it, but it might be irritating when trying to wash it by hand because it\u2019s so bendy. A lot of people raise concerns about chemicals in this material, so you\u2019ll be glad to know that this set is FDA approved and non-toxic.\nThe set comes with three items \u2013 a round cake pan, a square brownie pan, and a banana bread/meatloaf pan.\nAll of the dishes are equipped with metal handles which allows for a nice and solid grip, so you won\u2019t have to worry about the pans slipping out of your hands.\nSilicone is generally oven safe up to 500 degrees F, which is fantastic and much better than some metal products, so you won\u2019t need to worry about burning your bakeware.\nHowever, the metal handles don't seem to take high temperatures very well, and I've heard some reports of them flaking and bubbling at 400 F.\nI hope that the article was helpful and that it got you acquainted with the basics of bakeware.\nNow, the time has come for me to declare my top pick of the day, and the product that got most of my sympathies is Rachel Ray\u2019s 10-piece Cucina Set.\nIts beautiful design is what attracted me to this bakeware set, but the excellent performance made an even stronger impression.\nNon-stick surface does its job flawlessly, and the carbon steel construction is sturdy and strong.\nThis is a very good list, i have tested myself the Rachel Ray\u2019s 10-Piece Cucina Bakeware Set and i\u2019m satisfied with it, it fulfill most of my daily cooking."}
{"doc_id": "16", "text": "Are film trailers spoiling movies?\nIn April we asked if high ticket prices were ruining your visits to the cinema. Yes, you said overwhelmingly. But something else has put a strain on my relationship with the cinema \u2013 and it\u2019s not the popcorn.\nHave you ever gone to your local cinema to watch a new film only to feel you\u2019ve seen it before? I know I have. \u2018Spoilerific\u2019 film trailers are now often so detailed it seems hardly worth watching the movie itself.\nImagine if the trailer for Casablanca told you whether Ingrid Bergman went off with Humphrey Bogart or Paul Henreid at the end. Or if the trailer for Citizen Kane revealed just what the dying man meant when he muttered the word \u2018Rosebud\u2019.\nAnd it seems that even some film directors agree. Colin Trevorrow, director of new film, Jurassic World, has said he think that trailers have shown far more of the film than he would have wanted.\nIn the last couple of months, I\u2019ve paid \u00a317.50 a ticket to see two films I\u2019ve been anticipating for some time. OK \u00a317.50 sounds steep, but that was for iMAX 3D and I\u2019d still have paid more than \u00a310 for a \u2018normal\u2019 ticket.\nBut I left the cinema unfulfilled, because I felt like I\u2019d seen them both six months before.\nIn both cases the trailer revealed the entire structure of the story, key plot twists and expensive action sequences. Throw in a few character deaths for good measure and you\u2019ve got the basis of a significant chunk of what you\u2019ve paid your money for.\nI really did feel cheated by what the studio had wanted me to see in advance.\nSo is this just a modern trend? I checked out trailers for 1981\u2019s Raiders of the Lost Ark, and 1964\u2019s Goldfinger to get a bigger picture.\nBoth revealed some well-known scenes (including Goldfinger\u2019s iconic laser and dialogue), but the plot basics were instead explained by voiceover, rather than any especially huge visual giveaways.\nBesides, the chance of actually seeing these trailers was significantly lessened due to the technology available at the time of release. Which got me thinking further.\n\u2018If you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t watch it\u2019, I hear you cry. I wish it were that simple. In the age of the internet, exposure has increased tenfold.\nMarketing campaigns target social media and television, while the days of a simple poster are gone. Why commission a still image when you can display scenes from the film on a screen in a station or other public place?\nNot only that, but trailers are also forced upon you in the cinema itself before other films. Without a blindfold and a soundproof booth to hide in you have little choice.\nIt\u2019s not that I have a problem with marketing and ads. But they\u2019re spoiling the experience. I don\u2019t want to see all the best bits wrapped up into two minutes, six months ahead of release.\nHave you had a film spoiled by its trailer/marketing? Is Hollywood revealing too much in a desperate attempt to put bums on seats?\nDo ticket prices ruin your film-going experience?\nSomething George mentioned earlier about Terminator 2 trailer jogged my memory about another film from the same franchise, Terminator Genisys.\nTo promote the film, a trailer had been released that included a major plot twist ACTUALLY in the trailer. Now, I had heard about this trailer and had been purposely avoiding it. However, even when you try to avoid spoilers, sometimes it\u2019s out of your control. When I went to see Mad Max, they showed the afore-mentioned trailer and before I realised, it was too late. It cannot be unseen.\nEven the director, Alan Taylor, was unhappy about the spoilers in the trailer.\nGenisys was [spoiler alert] \u2026.. indeed half of the inspiration for this convo. I saw that article about Alan Taylor\u2019s thoughts the other day, but could only sympathise so much as the film was, in my opinion, a travesty.\nHave you seen the film now Ryan? If so what did you think of the big \u2018reveal\u2019? For a film that had very little else going for it that really did completely spoil the experience for me.\nI just can\u2019t understand why that decision was taken. You don\u2019t need to resort to something like that to generate interest \u2013 if said twist is that good then word of mouth will spread.\nFor anyone interested, the trailer for the new Bond film was released today."}

Take a look at the complete story after the jump.\nFrom the architects: The centrally located 16,000 square meter site was purchased by Gro\u00df & Partner real estate development company \u2013 who will be carrying out the development of the project \u2013 back in 2015. Situated in the very core of the city, the site has been completely inaccessible for the last 45 years. Now four new high-rise towers will change Frankfurt\u2019s skyline from the air, while cultivating its liveliness on the ground. The development of these towers, reaching heights of 228 meters, will open up new streets to create a multi-use, vibrant inner-city quarter, bringing together a healthy mix of work, living, relaxation and recreation.\nThe choice of programmes allows for a smooth transition from Frankfurt\u2019s shopping district to the east of Ro\u00dfmarkt, to the high-rise office towers clustered around Park Taunusanlage. With a development concept that is unique to Europe, the FOUR Frankfurt project brings together facilities that will establish a lively new neighbourhood for Frankfurt, its visitors, and its (future) residents.\nThe new high-rise complex will be integrated into the expanding city structure by incorporating the heritage-listed facades of the Junghofstra\u00dfe into the design and by making a multi-storey base building the connecting element of the entire site.\nAccording to the assessment by the competition jury, the unique quality of the quarter can be found in its public development and amenity value. The new development will therefore create connected spaces, accessible rooftops, pathways and passages. The existing block on the Junghofstra\u00dfe will be opened up to strengthen the surrounding pathways and ensure a high level of accessibility. This will create a multi-use, diverse quarter comprising 50% office spaces, 30% living accommodation (including subsidized housing), in addition to retail spaces, restaurants and hotels.\nFour Frankfurt is expected to be completed in 2023."}

Amethyst ranges from light to dark purple. See the Amethyst gemstone page for more details.\nCitrine is the yellow, orange, or reddish-brown variety of Quartz.

See the Smoky Quartz gemstone page for more details.\nThe rosy pink variety of Quartz is known as Rose Quartz, and its color is usually soft, ranging from very light pink to medium pink in intensity. Rose Quartz is often milky or hazy, and it may lack good transparency. See the Rose Quartz gemstone page for more details.\nThe colorless, transparent variety of Quartz, free of any impurities, is known as \"Rock Crystal\". Flawless and very large cuts may be cut from Rock Crystal.\nMilky Quartz is the white, translucent to opaque variety of Quartz. Though very common in nature, it is not used as a gemstone.\nColorless Quartz with golden yellow Rutile inclusions, as hairlike growths within the gemstone, are known as Rutilated Quartz. See the Rutilated Quartz gemstone page for more details.\nAmetrine is an interesting, color-zoned combination of purple Amethyst and brownish-yellow Citrine. See the Ametrine gemstone page for more details.\nPrasiolite, or Green Quartz, describes a light green Quartz artificially colored by heat treatment of certain types of Amethyst. May also be called \"Green Amethyst\" by some jewelers.\nThe blue variety of Quartz, which is uncommon in nature, is seldom used as a gemstone. Most \"Blue Quartz\" is clear Rock Crystal irradiated with gold to from a deep sky blue color. Blue Quartz may also refer to a dull grayish-blue Quartz in massive form with Crocidolite inclusions.\nColorless Quartz with Tourmaline inclusions, often as thin long black crystals, is known as \"Tourmalinated Quartz\".\nCat's Eye Quartz is Quartz with dense, tiny Rutile inclusions that cause a cat's eye effect. It is not common, and the chatoyant effect is usually weak. Cat's Eye Quartz is usually grayish in color and translucent.\nAll forms of Quartz are used as gemstones, and they are all affordable. They are cut into various gemstone cuts and cabochons, and used in all forms of jewelry. Lesser quality stones are often tumbled for use in bracelets, necklaces, and as costume jewelery. Large spheres and carvings are also cut from all the Quartz forms. Due to its abundance and lack of luster, Rock Crystal is not commonly cut into gemstones, although some very large spheres and sculptures are carved from it. Small crystals of Rock Crystal are sometime worn as pendants, sometimes being polished and smoothed, and sometimes in their entirely natural crystal form.\nVarieties specific to Amethyst, Citrine, Smoky Quartz, Rose Quartz, Rutilated Quartz, and Chalcedony are listed separately.\nAmethyst\t- Purple variety of Quartz, and its most popular and valuable gemstone variety. (See the Amethyst gemstone page for more details.) Tumbled Amethyst with white Milky Quartz is sometimes known as Amethyst Quartz.\nAventurine\t- Opaque, compact Quartz / Chalcedony containing small Mica, Hematite, or Goethite scales which cause a glistening effect. Aventurine is most often green but may also be other colors such as gray, orange, and brown.\nBlue Quartz - Rare natural blue variety of Quartz. It is caused by inclusions of blue minerals, especially Dumortierite. Most \"Blue Quartz\" is what is popularly known as \"Aqua Aura\", essentially clear Rock Crystal synthetically irradiated with gold to form a deep sky blue color. Blue Quartz may also refer to a dull grayish-blue Quartz in massive form with Crocidolite inclusions.\nCat's Eye Quartz - Quartz with dense, tiny Rutile inclusions that cause a cat's eye effect. Cat's Eye Quartz is not common, and the chatoyant effect is usually weak. Cat's Eye Quartz is usually grayish in color and translucent.\nLemon Quartz - Lemon Quartz is a light to dark yellow Citrine, distinguished from most Citrine by lacking orange, brown, or reddish tints. More often though it is clear Quartz that is irradiated to produce an intensely colored yellow gemstone. Lemon Quartz has recently experienced a popularity increase in the gemstone market.\nMilky Quartz - White, translucent to opaque variety of Quartz. It is not commonly used as a gemstone.\nPrase - Light to emerald green, transparent to translucent Quartz / Chalcedony, with coloring caused from inclusions of green minerals, such as Actinolite, Hedenbergite, Chlorite, or Malachite.\nPrasiolite - Light green gem form Quartz artificially colored by heat treatment of certain types of Amethyst. May also be called Green Amethyst by some jewelers.\nRock Crystal - The colorless, transparent variety of Quartz, free of impurities is called \"Rock Crystal\".\nTourmalinated Quartz - Quartz with splintery Tourmaline inclusions.\nAmethyst may be heat treated to deepen the purple color. Most gem Citrine is produced by heat treating Amethyst, and the green Quartz known as Prasiolite or \"Green Amethyst\" is also produced by heating Amethyst from specific localities.\nCertain colorful Quartz types not found in nature are produced through irradiation. Some forms of Quartz with a multicolored rainbow effect are synthetically treated to produce their color effect using film deposition. The process involves bonding an extremely thin metallic film layer over the top of the gemstone, so that the interesting color effects are reflected from the crown. Some vividly colorful forms of Quartz are synthetic grown using the hydrothermal method.\nQuartz is extremely common and is found in numerous localities throughout the world. The important sources are far too numerous to mention, though in general the most prolific countries that produce Quartz gemstones are Brazil, Madagascar, India, and the U.S. (Arkansas). Specific sources for the popular Quartz varieties are described on their dedicated pages.\nSee the individual variety pages for specific variety similarities.\nRock crystal is similar to glass, but the softness of glass usually lends it to scratches and soft etches which are lacking on Rock Crystal. Rock Crystal is rarely cut into small facets, so it usually is not a concern of confusion to other colorless gems such as Diamond, White Topaz, and White Sapphire. These white gemstones will also have a greater dispersion and exhibit more fire.\nAdditional images for the varieties Amethyst, Citrine, Smoky Quartz, Rose Quartz, Rutilated Quartz, and Chalcedony are listed separately.\nHave a question about Quartz?

The Chinese company\u2019s official port of PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds (PUBG) is now available on iOS and Android worldwide.\nWe tried PUBG on iPhone X when it released in China last month and came away very impressed. It successfully squeezed much of the PC and Xbox game down to a much smaller screen -- and in places looked even better than the Xbox One version of the game.\nIt comes a week after rival Fortnite began inviting players to test its own mobile version. Unlike PUBG, Fortnite will allow players to play across platforms -- meaning iPhone players can kill or be killed by gamers on PC or PlayStation 4.\nFortnite recently surpassed pioneer PUBG in popularity. Both games feature 100 players landing on a deserted island filled with weapons, with everyone fighting to be the last person left standing. While PUBG adopts a realistic setting, Fortnite has a more cartoon-like look -- and an emphasis on building structures sets it apart from its rival.\nBut Tencent may find its main competition for PUBG on mobile could come from other Chinese companies. NetEase was quick to copy PUBG and released similar games for smartphone while the original was still on PC. NetEase says just one of its clones, Knives Out, has over 100 million registered players -- far more than the 40 million playing PUBG on PC and Xbox."}

Since last June, they\u2019ve been arranging for professional and corporate volunteers to dedicate some of their time to helping Thames Reach clients at iReach, a weekly digital skills workshop at our Employment Academy in Camberwell.\niReach gives people with little or no computer skills the opportunity to learn at their own pace.

People working in a professional or corporate environment will tend to have digital skills they can impart through sessions like iReach, which is a fantastic project.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really enjoyed working with Thames Reach and will continue to do so. We\u2019ve had 23 volunteers helping out with iReach. They share their expertise and make contact with people in their communities they might otherwise never have met,\u201d she said.\nThames Reach digital support worker Chris Hamm, who runs the iReach sessions, said: \u201cWhen our service users first arrive, some are apprehensive about using the equipment. Some have almost no previous experience of using computers.\n\u201cAfter a while, though, you can see how self-confident our learners become.

Unlocator allows you to unblock and watch ABC in the UK. You can check the list of 214 channels they allow you to unblock.\nSo, you can either use VPN or Smart DNS proxy to unblock and watch ABC in the UK.

But for Butler, it has only enhanced his confidence.\nAs it stands, 22-year-old Butler is not regarded as the best wide receiver in this year\u2019s NFL Draft. He\u2019s projected by some experts to go as late as the third round. But when wide receivers were measured Thursday, Butler gained some attention: He led all receivers in height (6-foot-5 3/8), arm length (35 1/4 inches) and wingspan (83 7/8 inches).\nOn Thursday, running back David Montgomery, who played with Butler at Iowa State, captured the general vibe surrounding Butler here.\nButler says he\u2019s met with every NFL team on an informal basis. He had \u201cnine or 10\u201d formal meetings set up for Friday night, but didn\u2019t divulge which teams he\u2019d be sitting down with.\nThere is clear interest in Butler, who declared for the draft after his junior season in which he had 60 receptions for 1,318 yards and nine touchdowns.\nBut in his mind, the hype machine hasn\u2019t been turned up high enough \u2014 yet.\nButler, of course, is talking about Saturday\u2019s wide receiver workouts. If he crushes the drills, he could vault up the draft board \u2014 perhaps into the first round. And he feels well-prepared because he\u2019s spent the past few months working out with some legendary NFL receivers in Calvin Johnson and Anquan Boldin.\nButler met Boldin at the South Florida gym where he trains. He was connected to Johnson through his agent.\nJohnson and Boldin are known for being precise, tactical receivers. But Butler says the most valuable lesson of working with them has been learning about how they think.\nButler admitted the first time he worked with Johnson, who went to six Pro Bowls with the Detroit Lions from 2010-15, that he was a little starstruck.\nButler is hoping that one day he can leave a legacy like Boldin or Johnson.

The problem may not be obvious, and it may not even be a problem that people are aware of, but the problem exists. Using Instagram as a case study, I think there are four keys a platforms success.\nMost people aren't professional photographers. They don't have access to the tools professional photographers use nor the time or money to buy the tools and learn them. But they do want professional looking photos. Instagram built a platform that had intrinsic value on it's own by providing people the ability to easily create professional looking photographs.\nOne of the keys that made Instagram successful was that they took something people were already doing and made it easier and better. They removed the need to download photos from a mobile device and then upload them from a desktop or laptop. They simplified the process and allowed users to share exiting photos right from their phones or take a new photo to share.\nThey also simplified an otherwise complex photo editing process by providing a set of templates that people could apply without having to understand image editing. This enabled a regular person to have professional looking photos without any work.\nOne thing that Instagram did very well is that it built it's software to work with exiting services like Facebook and Twitter. Services that already had a huge community of users. They didn't try to re-create Twitter or Facebook. Instead, they allowed Twitter and Facebook to get better by making their service interoperable.\nInstagram didn't force people to ONLY use their service. Instead, it allowed people to continue to use their existing social media services and augment a specific workflow to be better if they wanted to. Users don't want to be asked to chose between this OR that. They want to be able to use this AND that. Will your software provide additional choices or limit choices?"}

Despite corresponding in-vitro gene expression studies being a focus of interest for many years, no information is available for hPDL fibroblasts on suitable reference genes, which are generally used in RT-qPCR experiments to normalize variability between samples. The aim of this study was to identify and validate suitable reference genes for normalization in untreated hPDL fibroblasts as well as experiments on orthodontic tooth movement or periodontitis (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). We investigated the suitability of 13 candidate reference genes using four different algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, comparative Delta C-q and BestKeeper) and ranked them according to their expression stability. Overall PPIB (peptidylprolyl isomerase A), TBP (TATA-box-binding protein) and RPL22 (ribosomal protein 22) were found to be most stably expressed with two genes in conjunction sufficient for reliable normalization.

{"doc_id": "59", "text": "Grace. What is it? What does it mean? How do you get it and how do you KNOW you got it?\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know the answers to these questions. I have no way of describing something I don\u2019t understand BUT believe deeply in my soul that it exists. How do you get these graces? Sanctifying grace is IN your soul. It\u2019s the free and underserved gift from God. Actual grace would come from our knowledge and belief of all things right and wrong \u2013 following the Ten Commandments, making sure we follow a path that is pure and justified. Justified means to be sinless, and to be sinless means you are in favor with God. When you are baptized you are sinless and therefore have favor with God. When you go to reconciliation, you are once again sinless and in favor with God. You are in a state of grace. Once sanctifying grace is in your soul, you can increase it by every good action you do \u2013 receiving Communion, saying prayers, performing corporal works of Mercy. The most important thing to think about is NOT what you are going to do or how you are going to do it but to recognize God\u2019s love. The reason you can do any good work is because God LOVES YOU FIRST in Grace. You must continually seek God\u2019s grace, continually respond to the actual graces God is working within you, inclining you to turn to Him and do good.\nHave I answered the question as to what Grace is? I\u2019ve read through all the study guides provided to me and compiled all the information, but I don\u2019t believe that I\u2019ve properly explained what Grace is.\nTo me Grace is a feeling. Sometimes it\u2019s butterflies in the stomach, and it takes my breath away. I feel this way every time I think of my husband. We met and married 38 years ago. I see God\u2019s grace in our meeting, getting married, and living our life together as husband and wife. Sometimes it\u2019s a jolt, like an electric shock and then an overwhelming wave of love, like the enormous amount of love I felt when I held my first baby in my arms for the first time. This happened again with my 2nd and 3rd child, and then God blessed us with twins to make 4 and 5. Then sometimes it feels like a raging fight going on inside me, making hard decisions that breaks my heart in two. I have no power to stop things from happening and my only recourse is just to constantly pray. Mostly it\u2019s a feeling of ultimate peace and an over-whelming calmness that comes over me at different times during the day when God allows me glimpses of HIS love for me: when my dog and cat are doing something cute together; when I see the birds eating the seed I put out for them; when a certain little girl comes over to the house and calls me \u201cGrandma\u201d. I just breathe a sigh of thanksgiving and relax in the comfort of His hand.\nWhere does Grace come from?"}

If food and drinks have stained your pearly whites, you may be tempted to rush to the drug store and pick up the first over-the-counter whitening product you find. However, while side effects from whitening products are rare, you should follow these tips before bleaching your teeth to ensure your safety.\nIf your teeth appear stained, don\u2019t assume you need to bleach them. It\u2019s possible a good teeth cleaning will restore the sparkle to your smile. During an oral exam, your dentist will also check for cavities and gum issues, which should be treated before bleaching your teeth.\nAt-home whiteners most often use carbamide peroxide in concentrations ranging from 10 to 20 percent. Carbamide peroxide is hydrogen peroxide with urea added. This product remains active for up to 10 hours at a low enough acidity level that enamel etching is not a concern.\nStart with a product containing 10 percent carbamide peroxide. If the whitener doesn\u2019t bother your mouth, but you don\u2019t see the results you want, try another over-the-counter product with a higher concentration.\nWhen you choose an at-home teeth bleaching kit, it\u2019s your responsibility to follow the instructions on the package. Don\u2019t leave the gel or strips on your teeth longer than advised or you could experience tooth sensitivity and sore gums. Also, avoid drinking soda, sports drinks or other sugary/acidic beverages for several hours after whitening to prevent etching your teeth.\nAt-home whitening kits are inexpensive and widely available, but that doesn\u2019t make them the best choice. Professional in-office teeth bleaching can lighten your smile up to eight shades in a single 45-minute visit. Combined with professional-grade take-home treatments, patients see an average improvement of 11 shades. In comparison, over-the-counter whitening requires daily 30-minute applications for more than two weeks to achieve a six-shade improvement.\nIn-office whitening uses LED light-activated technology to maximize results in the shortest amount of time without causing tooth sensitivity. It\u2019s effective both for people who simply want to lighten their smile and for patients with severely discolored teeth.\nPregnant women and nursing mothers should postpone teeth bleaching.\nTranslucent teeth don\u2019t respond well to whitening. A tooth-colored composite placed on the lingual side of a see-through tooth is a more effective way to improve its appearance.\nZen Dental Center in Seattle offers Philips Zoom in-office teeth bleaching for safe, professional results.

{"doc_id": "63", "text": "Yesterday [12 Nov], at the Shoreditch Town Hall, Dr. Macdonald, M.P., the coroner for the North- Eastern District of Middlesex, opened his inquiry relative to the death of Marie Jeanette Kelly, the woman whose body was discovered on Friday morning, terribly mutilated, in a room on the ground floor of 26, Dorset-street, entrance to which was by a side door in Miller's-court.\nSuperintendent T. Arnold, H Division; Inspector Abberline, of the Criminal Investigation Department, and Inspector Nairn represented the police. The deputy coroner, Mr. Hodgkinson, was present during the proceedings.\nThe Coroner (to the juror, severely): Do you think that we do not know what we are doing here, and that we do not know our own district? The jury are summoned in the ordinary way, and they have no business to object. If they persist in their objection I shall know how to deal with them. Does any juror persist in objecting ?\nThe Juror: We are summoned for the Shoreditch district. This affair happened in Spitalfields. The Coroner: It happened within my district.\nThe jury having made no further objection, they were duly sworn, and were conducted by Inspector Abberline to view the body, which, decently coffined, was at the mortuary adjoining Shoreditch Church, and subsequently the jury inspected the room, in Miller's-court, Dorset- street, where the murder was committed. The apartment, a plan of which was given in yesterday's Daily Telegraph, is poorly furnished, and uncarpeted. The position of the two tables was not altered. One of them was placed near the bed, behind the door, and the other next to the largest of the two windows which look upon the yard in which the dustbin and water-tap are situated.\nJoseph Barnett deposed : I was a fish-porter, and I work as a labourer and fruit- porter. Until Saturday last I lived at 24, New-street, Bishopsgate, and have since stayed at my sister's, 21, Portpool-lane, Gray's Inn-road. I have lived with the deceased one year and eight months. Her name was Marie Jeanette Kelly with the French spelling as described to me. Kelly was her maiden name. I have seen the body, and I identify it by the ear and eyes, which are all that I can recognise; but I am positive it is the same woman I knew. I lived with her in No. 13 room, at Miller's-court for eight months. I separated from her on Oct. 30.\n[Coroner] Why did you leave her ? - Because she had a woman of bad character there, whom she took in out of compassion, and I objected to it. That was the only reason. I left her on the Tuesday between five and six p.m. I last saw her alive between half-past seven and a quarter to eight on Thursday night last, when I called upon her. I stayed there for a quarter of an hour.\n[Coroner] Were you on good terms ? - Yes, on friendly terms; but when we parted I told her I had no work, and had nothing to give her, for which I was very sorry.\n[Coroner] Did you drink together ? - No, sir. She was quite sober.\n[Coroner] Was she, generally speaking, of sober habits ? - When she was with me I found her of sober habits, but she has been drunk several times in my presence.\n[Coroner] Was there any one else there on the Thursday evening ? - Yes, a woman who lives in the court. She left first, and I followed shortly afterwards.\n[Coroner] Have you had conversation with deceased about her parents ? - Yes, frequently. She said she was born in Limerick, and went when very young to Wales. She did not say how long she lived there, but that she came to London about four years ago. Her father's name was John Kelly, a \"gaffer\" or foreman in an iron works in Carnarvonshire, or Carmarthen. She said she had one sister, who was respectable, who travelled from market place to market place. This sister was very fond of her. There were six brothers living in London, and one was in the army. One of them was named Henry. I never saw the brothers to my knowledge. She said she was married when very young in Wales to a collier. I think the name was Davis or Davies. She said she had lived with him until he was killed in an explosion, but I cannot say how many years since that was. Her age was, I believe, 16 when she married. After her husband's death deceased went to Cardiff to a cousin.\n[Coroner] Did she live there long ? - Yes, she was in an infirmary there for eight or nine months. She was following a bad life with her cousin, who, as I reckon, and as I often told her, was the cause of her downfall.\n[Coroner] After she left Cardiff did she come direct to London ? - Yes. She was in a gay house in the West-end, but in what part she did not say. A gentleman came there to her and asked her if she would like to go to France.\n[Coroner] Did she go to France ? - Yes; but she did not remain long. She said she did not like the part, but whether it was the part or purpose I cannot say. She was not there more than a fortnight, and she returned to England, and went to Ratcliffe-highway. She must have lived there for some time. Afterwards she lived with a man opposite the Commercial Gas Works, Stepney. The man's name was Morganstone.\n[Coroner] Have you seen that man ? - Never. I don't know how long she lived with him.\n[Coroner] Was Morganstone the last man she lived with ? - I cannot answer that question, but she described a man named Joseph Fleming, who came to Pennington-street, a bad house, where she stayed. I don't know when this was. She was very fond of him. He was a mason's plasterer, and lodged in the Bethnal-green-road.\n[Coroner] Was that all you knew of her history when you lived with her? - Yes. After she lived with Morganstone or Fleming - I don't know which one was the last - she lived with me.\n[Coroner] Where did you pick up with her first ? - In Commercial-street. We then had a drink together, and I made arrangements to see her on the following day - a Saturday. On that day we both of us agreed that we should remain together. I took lodgings in George-street, Commercial-street, where I was known. I lived with her, until I left her, on very friendly terms.\n[Coroner] Did she express fear of any particular individual ? - No, sir. Our own quarrels were very soon over.\nThomas Bowyer stated: I live at 37, Dorset-street, and am employed by Mr. McCarthy. I serve in his chandler's shop, 27, Dorset-street. At a quarter to eleven a.m., on Friday morning, I was ordered by McCarthy to go to Mary Jane's room, No. 13. I did not know the deceased by the name of Kelly. I went for rent, which was in arrears. Knocking at the door, I got no answer, and I knocked again and again. Receiving no reply, I passed round the corner by the gutter spout where there is a broken window - it is the smallest window.\nCharles Ledger, an inspector of police, G Division, produced a plan of the premises. Bowyer pointed out the window, which was the one nearest the entrance.\nHe [Bowyer] continued: There was a curtain. I put my hand through the broken pane and lifted the curtain. I saw two pieces of flesh lying on the table.\n[Coroner] Where was this table ? - In front of the bed, close to it. The second time I looked I saw a body on this bed, and blood on the floor. I at once went very quietly to Mr. McCarthy. We then stood in the shop, and I told him what I had seen. We both went to the police-station, but first of all we went to the window, and McCarthy looked in to satisfy himself. We told the inspector at the police-station of what we had seen. Nobody else knew of the matter. The inspector returned with us.\n[Coroner] Did you see the deceased constantly ? - I have often seen her. I knew the last witness, Barnett. I have seen the deceased drunk once.\nJohn McCarthy, grocer and lodging-house keeper, testified: I live at 27, Dorset- street. On Friday morning, about a quarter to eleven, I sent my man Bowyer to Room 13 to call for rent. He came back in five minutes, saying, \"Guv'nor, I knocked at the door, and could not make any one answer; I looked through the window and saw a lot of blood.\" I accompanied him, and looked through the window myself, saw the blood and the woman. For a moment I could not say anything, and I then said: \"You had better fetch the police.\" I knew the deceased as Mary Jane Kelly, and had no doubt at all about her identity. I followed Bowyer to Commercial-street Police-station, where I saw Inspector Beck. I inquired at first for Inspector Reid. Inspector Beck returned with me at once.\n[Coroner] How long had the deceased lived in the room ? - Ten months. She lived with Barnett. I did not know whether they were married or not; they lived comfortably together, but they had a row when the window was broken. The bedstead, bed-clothes, table, and every article of furniture belonged to me.\n[Coroner] What rent was paid for this room ? - It was supposed to be 4s 6d a week. Deceased was in arrears 29s. I was to be paid the rent weekly. Arrears are got as best you can. I frequently saw the deceased the worse for drink. When sober she was an exceptionally quiet woman, but when in drink she had more to say. She was able to walk about, and was not helpless.\n[Coroner] Where was this ? - In Dorset-street. She went up the court, a few steps in front of me.\n[Coroner] Was anybody with her ? - A short, stout man, shabbily dressed. He had on a longish coat, very shabby, and carried a pot of ale in his hand.\n[Coroner] What was the colour of the coat ? - A dark coat.\n[Coroner] What hat had he ? - A round hard billycock.\n[Coroner] Long or short hair ? - I did not notice. He had a blotchy face, and full carrotty moustache.\n[Coroner] The chin was shaven ? - Yes. A lamp faced the door.\n[Coroner] Did you see them go into her room ? - Yes; I said \"Good night, Mary,\" and she turned round and banged the door.\n[Coroner] Had he anything in his hands but the can ? - No.\n[Coroner] Did she say anything ? - She said \"Good night, I am going to have a song.\" As I went in she sang \"A violet I plucked from my mother's grave when a boy.\" I remained a quarter of an hour in my room and went out. Deceased was still singing at one o'clock when I returned. I remained in the room for a minute to warm my hands as it was raining, and went out again. She was singing still, and I returned to my room at three o'clock. The light was then out and there was no noise.\n[Coroner] Did you go to sleep ? - No; I was upset. I did not undress at all. I did not sleep at all. I must have heard what went on in the court. I heard no noise or cry of \"Murder,\" but men went out to work in the market.\n[Coroner] How many men live in the court who work in Spitalfields Market ? - One. At a quarter- past six I heard a man go down the court. That was too late for the market.\n[Coroner] From what house did he go ? - I don't know.\n[Coroner] Did you hear the door bang after him ? - No.\n[Coroner] Then he must have walked up the court and back again? - Yes.\n[Coroner] It might have been a policeman ? - It might have been.\n[Coroner] What would you take the stout man's age to be ? - Six-and-thirty.\n[Coroner] Did you notice the colour of his trousers ? - All his clothes were dark.\n[Coroner] Did his boots sound as if the heels were heavy ? - There was no sound as he went up the court.\n[Coroner] Then you think that his boots were down at heels ? - He made no noise.\n[Coroner] What clothes had Mary Jane on ? - She had no hat; a red pelerine and a shabby skirt.\n[Coroner] You say she was drunk ? - I did not notice she was drunk until she said good night. The man closed the door. By the Jury: There was a light in the window, but I saw nothing, as the blinds were down. I should know the man again, if I saw him.\n[Coroner] Do you often hear cries of \"Murder?\" - It is nothing unusual in the street. I did not take particular notice.\n[Coroner] Did you hear it a second time? - No.\n[Coroner] Did you hear beds or tables being pulled about? - None whatever. I went asleep, and was awake again at five a.m. I passed down the stairs, and saw some men harnessing horses. At a quarter to six I was in the Ten Bells.\n[Coroner] Could the witness, Mary Ann Cox, have come down the entry between one and half-past one o'clock without your knowledge ? - Yes, she could have done so.\n[Coroner] Did you see any strangers at the Ten Bells ? - No. I went back to bed and slept until eleven.\n[Coroner] You heard no singing downstairs ? - None whatever. I should have heard the singing distinctly. It was quite quiet at half-past one o'clock.\nCaroline Maxewell, 14, Dorset-street, said: My husband is a lodging-house deputy. I knew the deceased for about four months. I believe she was an unfortunate. On two occasions I spoke to her.\n[Coroner] Did you speak to her ? - Yes; it was an unusual thing to see her up. She was a young woman who never associated with any one. I spoke across the street, \"What, Mary, brings you up so early ?\" She said, \"Oh, Carrie, I do feel so bad.\"\n[Coroner] And yet you say you had only spoken to her twice previously; you knew her name and she knew yours ? - Oh, yes; by being about in the lodging-house.\n[Coroner] What did she say ? - She said, \"I've had a glass of beer, and I've brought it up again\"; and it was in the road. I imagined she had been in the Britannia beer-shop at the corner of the street. I left her, saying that I could pity her feelings. I went to Bishopsgate-street to get my husband's breakfast. Returning I saw her outside the Britannia public-house, talking to a man.\n[Coroner] This would be about what time ? - Between eight and nine o'clock. I was absent about half-an-hour. It was about a quarter to nine.\n[Coroner] What description can you give of this man ? - I could not give you any, as they were at some distance.\n[Coroner] What sort of dress had the deceased ? - A dark skirt, a velvet body, a maroon shawl, and no hat.\n[Coroner] Have you ever seen her the worse for drink ? - I have seen her in drink, but she was not a notorious character.\nSarah Lewis deposed: I live at 24, Great Pearl-street, and am a laundress. I know Mrs. Keyler, in Miller's-court, and went to her house at 2, Miller's-court, at 2.30a.m. on Friday. It is the first house. I noticed the time by the Spitalfields' Church clock. When I went into the court, opposite the lodging-house I saw a man with a wideawake. There was no one talking to him. He was a stout-looking man, and not very tall. The hat was black. I did not take any notice of his clothes. The man was looking up the court; he seemed to be waiting or looking for some one. Further on there was a man and woman - the later being in drink. There was nobody in the court. I dozed in a chair at Mrs. Keyler's, and woke at about half- past three. I heard the clock strike.\n[Coroner] What woke you up ? - I could not sleep. I sat awake until nearly four, when I heard a female's voice shouting \"Murder\" loudly. It seemed like the voice of a young woman. It sounded at our door. There was only one scream.\n[Coroner] Were you afraid ? Did you wake anybody up ? - No, I took no notice, as I only heard the one scream.\n[Coroner] You stayed at Keyler's house until what time ? - Half-past five p.m. on Friday. The police would not let us out of the court.\n[Coroner] Have you seen any suspicious persons in the district ? - On Wednesday night I was going along the Bethnal-green-road, with a woman, about eight o'clock, when a gentleman passed us. He followed us and spoke to us, and wanted us to follow him into an entry. He had a shiny leather bag with him.\n[Coroner] Did he want both of you ? - No; only one. I refused. He went away and came back again, saying he would treat us. He put down his bag and picked it up again, saying, \"What are you frightened about ? Do you think I've got anything in the bag ?\" We then ran away, as we were frightened.\n[Coroner] Was he a tall man ? - He was short, pale-faced, with a black moustache, rather small. His age was about forty.\n[Coroner] Was it a large bag ? - No, about 6in to 9in long. His hat was a high round hat. He had a brownish overcoat, with a black short coat underneath. His trousers were a dark pepper-and- salt.\n[Coroner] After he left you what did you do ? - We ran away.\n[Coroner] Have you seen him since ? - On Friday morning, about half-past two a.m., when I was going to Miller's-court, I met the same man with a woman in Commercial-street, near Mr. Ringer's public-house (the Britannia). He had no overcoat on.\n[Coroner] Had he the black bag ? - Yes.\n[Coroner] Were the man and woman quarrelling ? - No; they were talking. As I passed he looked at me. I don't know whether he recognised me. There was no policeman about.\nMr. George Bagster Phillips, divisional surgeon of police, said: I was called by the police on Friday morning at eleven o'clock, and on proceeding to Miller's-court, which I entered at 11.15, I found a room, the door of which led out of the passage at the side of 26, Dorset-street, photographs of which I produce. It had two windows in the court. Two panes in the lesser window were broken, and as the door was locked I looked through the lower of the broken panes and satisfied myself that the mutilated corpse lying on the bed was not in need of any immediate attention from me, and I also came to the conclusion that there was nobody else upon the bed, or within view, to whom I could render any professional assistance. Having ascertained that probably it was advisable that no entrance should be made into the room at that time, I remained until about 1.30p.m., when the door was broken open by McCarthy, under the direction of Superintendent Arnold. On the door being opened it knocked against a table which was close to the left-hand side of the bedstead, and the bedstead was close against the wooden partition. The mutilated remains of a woman were lying two- thirds over, towards the edge of the bedstead, nearest the door. Deceased had only an under- linen garment upon her, and by subsequent examination I am sure the body had been removed, after the injury which caused death, from that side of the bedstead which was nearest to the wooden partition previously mentioned. The large quantity of blood under the bedstead, the saturated condition of the palliasse, pillow, and sheet at the top corner of the bedstead nearest to the partition leads me to the conclusion that the severance of the right carotid artery, which was the immediate cause of death, was inflicted while the deceased was lying at the right side of the bedstead and her head and neck in the top right-hand corner.\nthe coroner said: It has come to my ears that somebody has been making a statement to some of the jury as to their right and duty of being here. Has any one during the interval spoken to the jury, saying that they should not be here to-day ?\nJulia Vanturney [Van Turney], 1, Miller's-court, a charwoman, living with Harry Owen, said: I knew the deceased for some time as Kelly, and I knew Joe Barnett, who lived with her. He would not allow her to go on the streets. Deceased often got drunk. She said she was fond of another man, also named Joe. I never saw this man. I believe he was a costermonger.\n[Coroner] When did you last see the deceased alive ? - On Thursday morning, at about ten o'clock. I slept in the court on Thursday night, and went to bed about eight. I could not rest at all during the night.\n[Coroner] Did you hear any noises in the court ? - I did not. I heard no screams of \"Murder,\" nor any one singing.\n[Coroner] Were you in the house when Joe Barnett called ? - Yes. I said, \"Well, Mary Jane, I shall not see you this evening again,\" and I left with her two men's dirty shirts, a little boy's shirt, a black overcoat, a black crepe bonnet with black satin strings, a pawn-ticket for a grey shawl, upon which 2s had been lent, and a little girls white petticoat.\n[Coroner] Have you seen any of these articles since? - Yes; I saw the black overcoat in a room in the court on Friday afternoon.\n[Coroner] Did the deceased ever speak to you about being afraid of any man ? - She did not.\nInspector Beck, H Division, deposed that, having sent for the doctor, he gave orders to prevent any persons leaving the court, and he directed officers to make a search. He had not been aware that the deceased was known to the police.\n[Coroner] Was it by your orders that the door was forced ? - No; I had an intimation from Inspector Beck that the bloodhounds had been sent for, and the reply had been received that they were on the way. Dr. Phillips was unwilling to force the door, as it would be very much better to test the dogs, if they were coming. We remained until about 1.30 p.m., when Superintendent Arnold arrived, and he informed me that the order in regard to the dogs had been countermanded, and he gave orders for the door to be forced. I agree with the medical evidence as to the condition of the room. I subsequently took an inventory of the contents of the room. There were traces of a large fire having been kept up in the grate, so much so that it had melted the spout of a kettle off. We have since gone through the ashes in the fireplace; there were remnants of clothing, a portion of a brim of a hat, and a skirt, and it appeared as if a large quantity of women's clothing had been burnt.\n[Coroner] Can you give any reason why they were burnt ? - I can only imagine that it was to make a light for the man to see what he was doing. There was only one small candle in the room, on the top of a broken wine-glass. An impression has gone abroad that the murderer took away the key of the room. Barnett informs me that it has been missing some time, and since it has been lost they have put their hand through the broken window, and moved back the catch. It is quite easy. There was a man's clay pipe in the room, and Barnett informed me that he smoked it.\n[Coroner] Is there anything further the jury ought to know ? - No; if there should be I can communicate with you, sir."}

{"doc_id": "66", "text": "Constant development in Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) technologies results in evolving aircraft, instrumentation, and control programs of these systems. An open source simulator was examined as a potential method of testing UAS platforms changes. The open source simulator was used to simulate flights flown by an actual platform. Existing flight data was used as a base line of comparison for the telemetry data of the simulated flight. Patterns in parameters such as vehicle attitude and throttle output were compared between the simulated and actual results to determine if the simulator produced an accurate representation of a physical flight. Analysis of the simulated vehicle exhibited similar behavior to that of the actual vehicle in most of the flight data collected. Simplification in the flight simulator model may be responsible for the deviations in magnitude observed between the two sets of data. Three points of interest in each of the three test cases were chosen as checks for the values in the data. These points in the flight were studied in the various graphs of the parameters graphed and the difference between the simulated and actual values was calculated. The values at these points stayed within an average of 0\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 for vehicle attitude and between 0% and 33.3% throttle difference over the three test cases. The average difference in attitude was 5.1\u00b0 over 93 compared values and 8.1% in throttle over 18 compared values. On average the simulator showed good agreement to existing flight data and therefore will be a good tool to simulate flights prior to a mission. The accuracy of the results may be improved with further development of the simulation model.\nRamirez Duarte, Jaime A.

{"doc_id": "69", "text": "I grew up with stove top mac and cheese. Luckily my mother often made her own from scratch, but I also had the commercial boxed mac and cheese as well. Personally I\u2019ve always prefered stove top to baked. I know, it is controversial. There is something to that velvety sauce and soft texture. It is simple and concise.\nHowever, as I grew up, the idea of making it from scratch seemed more and more improbable. So I leaned toward the box. Now I am not saying that something is bad if it is in a box but powdered things often don\u2019t feel super healthy in the food realm. Especially if all you are adding to them is butter and hot sauce and maybe tuna from a can. Wait. What?\nYes. I would like to take a moment to address something that we call \u201cShame Food.\u201d What is Shame Food? Shame Food is food that you only feel comfortable eating in private. Far from any witnesses. My big Shame Food experience was when I was doing social work. I would work all day in a pretty intense environment and then commute home and my wife worked another 5-6 hours. So I would get home, eat something, and then take a nap. That thing became my Shame Food. It was inspired by a natural food company\u2019s spicy mac and cheese. (It has since been discontinued.) I would make mac and cheese and add a lot of cheap hot sauce (this was before we had a sauce business) and a can of tuna. I would not even plate it. I would eat the whole thing out of the pot and then take a nap. I mean the nap wasn\u2019t a choice. That box of noodles is meant to feed a family of four. Plus the amount of hot sauce I added meant I wasn\u2019t really enjoying the meal as much as surviving it. I had to recoup.\nThis recipe isn\u2019t that dish. It is tied to that spicy boxed macaroni and cheese, that my wife introduced me to, and we would eat it together at a time that we didn\u2019t eat much. Also the roots are a stove top mac and cheese. The kind where the only powder involved it mustard powder and the spice comes from a complex sauce with a bright balsamic flavor and a nutty essence that pairs well with the gruyere and trust me if you finish it with toasted sesame, you will not regret it. Please enjoy and feel free to share with us your Shame Food.\nPour the pasta into a strainer and place the empty pot back on the stove.\nTurn heat to medium and add the butter.\nOnce the butter has melted, stir in the flour and use a whisk continue for a minute.\nSlowly add the milk and cream while whisking to combine.\nAdd the mustard powder and stir.\nReduce heat to medium-low and add the mascarpone. Continue to whisk.\nBegin adding the cheese a handful at a time while whisking to combine.\nAdd the Hatch Sesame Balsamic Sauce.\nReturn the pasta to the sauce pan and stir to coat.\nIf the sauce seems a little loose then continue to stir the pasta occasionally on low heat.\nServe in bowls topped with toasted sesame seeds and Mexican oregano."}

{"doc_id": "72", "text": "Last night a few of us from The Bier Abbey had the opportunity to stop down the Capital Region\u2019s newest brewery, Rare Form Brewing Company, meet owners Kevin Mullen and Jenny Kemp, check out the new space, and of course try some beers they had on tap. It was a breath of fresh air, for both the continuation of the improvement of Troy, but also for the craft beer scene in the Upstate New York.\nThe taproom itself looks bigger than it really is, given that the brewery is directly behind the bar. The bar area holds about 40 people, with a small room off to the side available for private groups or holding tastings. Stools and standing room are available at the bar, while there are some tables and benches off to each side.\nThe brew house is a Beast 5 BBL system from Psycho Brew that allows for brewing either a double batch or two beers at the same time, which will be nice to do some smaller experimental batches.\nThe taps are split between the two sides of the bar, each side with its own glass rinser, which is good to see (nothing worse than putting good beer in a dirty glass). There will be a couple of nitro offerings, as well.\nWhile looking around I was a little confused exactly where their cooler was, not realizing there was a downstairs not readily visible from the bar. Kevin took me for a quick tour of the cooler they made themselves. It looks like they have plenty of Rare Form branded cooperage hiding out down there.\nBack at the bar, glass sizes vary depending on the beer and ABV, and as Todd pointed out last night it would be nice to see glass sizes listed on the chalkboard as well. There are still some folks who don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d that not all beers are meant to be served in a 16 ounce glass, and it can be a shock when someone is served a beer in a glass half the size than what they were expecting.\nAs for the beers themselves, I\u2019ll be honest, whenever I walk into a new brewery opening up in the Capital Region, I have my reservations and things were no different yesterday at Rare Form. I\u2019ve been burned more often than I would like to admit by local brewers who started as homebrewers, were encouraged by friends and family to start brewery, and never really upped their game. Kevin has been brewing in various stages for \u201cmore than half [his] life\u201d at this point, and I gotta say I walked away extremely impressed.\nSabbatical Session Ale \u2013 a session rye ale coming in under 4% ABV with enough rye to keep things interesting without being over the top by the end of the glass.\nL\u2019homme Chat Belgian Black Ale \u2013 an odd beer, as \u201csession Belgian black ale\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily roll off the tongue but this definitely worked surprisingly well. I thought about adding this in Untappd but I couldn\u2019t figure out what style to consider this. I\u2019ll let someone else figure it out. Also below 4%.\nWee Plaid Scottish Ale \u2013 tons of malty caramel notes without being cloying.\nCascadia Double IPA \u2013 a DIPA with a \u201cmalty backbone\u201d and some piney, some citrusy hops.\nKarass Robust Porter \u2013 a classic porter I was unfair to compare side by side with Hill Farmstead\u2019s Everett. Still, Karass held it\u2019s own and had a simple, but great roasty flavor.\nSatan\u2019s Gut Oak-Aged Imperial Stout \u2013 a big beer, with some coffee notes and oak present from the oak chips but not much from the bourbon the chips were soaked in.\nFirst off, all of the beers were extremely drinkable. I like the focus on the session beers which are already very popular this year and\u2026 I feel bad that I need to even say this but\u2026 none of them had any glaring flaws or tasted like the dreaded \u201chomebrew on a bigger system\u201d as mentioned above. I\u2019m sure Kevin is going to do some tweaks as he gets used to brewing consequetive batches on this much bigger system and the beers are only going to improve.\nThe one change I would love to see would be with the Cascadia Double IPA. Just from a demographic perspective, in 2014, in this location, we live where New England\u2019s Gandhi Bot and Coriolis will kick in a matter of hours. We have no problem driving to MA to Tree House or VT to Alchemist/Hill/Lawson\u2019s for IPAs. And Rushing Duck\u2019s War Elephant is one of our most popular local beers. I think it\u2019s pretty clear that malty and piney are not characteristics Capital Region folks are craving for in their IPA, and most of the time any malt presence in an IPA is usually considered \u201cold\u201d to beer geeks these days. I\u2019d love to see Rare Form offer another IPA where the malt steps aside and lets some super juicy, tropical, citrusy notes shine, as that\u2019s more in line with what\u2019s popular in the Northeast today.\nBeyond the beer, some Rare Form swag is also available including shirts, sweatshirts and aluminum growlers for beer to go, although I did not see pricing for growler fills. No #properglassware yet but I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll happen down the road.\nAs Rare Form is the beginning of the transformation of the corner of Congress St and 4th, I got the chance to check out the progress with the rest of the space, including The Shop, a beer bar that\u2019s adjacent to the brewery. The opening is still a couple of months out, but some of the detail in the work happening there currently looks insanely good. A delicatessen at the corner of the building is also in the works and overall the building is shaping up nicely.\nAs some of you know, I\u2019m a little (OK, a lot) harsh on breweries in Upstate NY. Living here, but having such great beer being made in all around us in New England has definitely made me a little jaded at this point. The big breweries in New York seem to be on cruise control, taking little to no risk with new beers. The smaller breweries, while opening up in rapid numbers haven\u2019t done much to shake things up either, and most wouldn\u2019t meet the standards set for the beers poured at The Bier Abbey (the only one I can think of off the top of my head that does would be Rushing Duck).\nThat said I have high hopes for Rare Form. They have a great brand, a website that looks like those of an established brewery, a small, but well put together tasting room, and brewing equipment that doesn\u2019t look like it is meant for homebrew or cobbled together from used parts from other breweries. Not to mention they are making some beer that\u2019s worthy of my recommendation to friends and fellow beer geeks for a brewery visit, and I would gladly serve to a patron at The Abbey if and when they\u2019re producing enough liquid for distribution. I see a lot of potential for Rare Form, and I wish Kevin and Jenny the best of luck.\nRare Form\u2019s Grand Opening is tomorrow, Friday May 30th at 4:30PM. Make sure to head down there to check them out!\nYou lift me up, then you let me down. I\u2019m talking about that Cascadia IPA of course. (I think it\u2019s a bit aspirational to call an 8.8% ABV beer a \u201cdouble\u201d. Imperial, maybe.) War Elephant, now that\u2019s an IPA to my liking. Hope the folks at Rare Form are paying attention to your comments.\nEven if they keep Cascadia the way it is there are still room for other IPAs in their lineup as well. Not that Cascadia is bad, just not the style I was hoping for.\nI had the Wee Plaid, Sabbatical and Satan\u2019s Gut when the owners came down for a cheese tasting at The Cheese Traveler. Most breweries in the Upstate area put out mediocre beer. Rare Form is not most breweries. I must say the Sabbatical is an excellent session ale.\nI think the Sabbatical is my favorite beer they do so far. Such great flavor out of a such a small beer, exactly what I want as these temps warm up."}

{"doc_id": "77", "text": "Aman Ullah is with Ro Nay San Lwin and 93 others.\nThe UN Security Council has issued a presidential statement on Myanmar complimenting and criticising the country over its stance on the Rohingya crisis and it also gave the government a month to \u201cget its act together\u201d. The 1,300- word statement was read out by the sitting President of UNSC Sebastiano Cardi, the Ambassador of Italy, at a formal UNSC session on Monday ( November 6, 2017) .\nA presidential statement is a statement made by the President of the Security Council on behalf of the Council, adopted at a formal meeting of the Council and issued as an official document of the Council.\nA Presidential Statement is often created when the United Nations Security Council cannot reach consensus or are prevented from passing a resolution by a permanent member\u2019s veto, or threat thereof. Such statements are similar in content, format, and tone to resolutions, but are not legally binding. The adoption of a Presidential Statement requires consensus, although Security Council members may abstain. The Statement is signed by the sitting Security Council President.\nIt was the first presidential statement in 10 years on Myanmar. The Security Council has adopted such statements against Myanmar only three times, with the last one coming a decade ago. Diplomats hailed the move as a unified international stand against a humanitarian crisis that has been called \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d by the U.N., U.S., France and the U.K.\nIt strongly condemned attacks against the Myanmar security forces carried out by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on August 25, and then expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d over the government\u2019s response, the alleged burning of villages and threats to villagers to flee, among others.\nIt called for reform in Myanmar\u2019s security and justice sectors and urged the government to work with Bangladesh and the UN to allow the voluntary return of refugees to their homes, on the basis of an October 24 memorandum of understanding between the two country.\nThe panel welcomed a \u201cunion enterprise mechanism\u201d for humanitarian assistance, resettlement and development in Rakhine.\nIt recommended the government ensure the mechanism supported such return and allow UN agencies full access, urging governments and all humanitarian partners to pay special attention to the needs of women, particular survivors of sexual violence.\nThe council said the government\u2019s primary responsibility is the protection of Myanmar\u2019s population, citizens or not. The statement reiterated concerns and demands previously laid out: an end to excessive military force in Rakhine province, a lack of humanitarian access for the U.N., a right of return for refugees, and steps to address the root causes of the conflict. The statement included most of the demands contained in a draft resolution presented last month by Britain and France, but that measure ran into strong opposition from China, a supporter of Myanmar\u2019s former ruling junta.\nIt is said that, China had indicated it was willing to resort to its veto power to block a resolution, but Beijing finally agreed to a statement during negotiations.\nThe action is one step below a Security Council resolution in diplomatic significance, but a step above the Council\u2019s previous action, a \u201cpress statement,\u201d in September.\nThe statement requires the U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres to report back to the Council within 30 days on Myanmar\u2019s progress in addressing the Council\u2019s demands. The statement isn\u2019t as binding as a resolution would be, and carries no punitive measures, such as sanctions, if corrective steps aren\u2019t taken.\nThe Security Council has held a series of meetings on Myanmar since September, including a briefing attended by high-level officials on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly gathering. But efforts to respond forcefully have stalled despite widespread reports of deaths, rapes and torture of Rohingya Muslim minorities, including women and children, at the hands of the country\u2019s military.\nViolence erupted in August after a Rohingya militant group attacked Myanmar security forces. Since late August, more than 600,000 Rohingya have been driven from their homes by an army campaign that the United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing.\nDuring negotiations with China, language on citizenship rights was watered down in the statement as was a demand that Myanmar allow a UN human rights mission into the country, diplomats said.\nThe statement calls on Myanmar to cooperate with the United Nations and encourages UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to appoint a special advisor on Myanmar.\nThe council statement was agreed as Guterres prepares to travel to Manila this week to join leaders of the Southeast Asian (ASEAN) bloc for a summit.\nThe council also welcomed the Myanmar government\u2019s public support for recommendations by the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State chaired by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and called for their full implementation.\nIt urged UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to consider appointing a special advisor on Myanmar.\nSince the August attacks, over 604,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh. Some fled by land, others in boats over an inlet of the Bay of Bengal.\nIn the last two weeks, 4,000 refugees entered Bangladesh while four people drowned in a shipwreck while fleeing, officials said.\nU.K Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: I am pleased that today (6 November) the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has spoken with one voice on the appalling situation in Rakhine State, Burma. The UK has repeatedly called on the Burmese security forces to protect all civilians and act now to stop the violence and allow humanitarian aid to urgently reach all those who need it. The UNSC has today joined us in that call, with this historic Presidential Statement on Burma.\nI am encouraged to see State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi making important steps forward, including establishing a domestic body to deliver humanitarian and development assistance in Rakhine, and making efforts to promote interfaith and intercommunal harmony, including a recent visit to northern Rakhine. The UK will be watching closely to ensure that the Burmese security forces do not attempt to frustrate these efforts.\nThe U.K. and France initially circulated a proposed Security Council resolution on Myanmar in late October, but China and Russia refused to engage and negotiate, diplomats said. China finally agreed to a similar text with minor changes as a presidential statement\u2014which carries less weight than a resolution\u2014and Russia followed suit.\nMr. Guterres has been outspoken about the Myanmar crisis and urged the Security Council to prevent continued bloodshed and curb the refugee flow. Mr. Guterres will be among the world leaders attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit later this week in Manila.\nThe Rohingya refugee crisis is expected to be a top issue of discussion at the summit, to be attended by US President Donald Trump, who will dispatch US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to Myanmar later this month. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will also attend that summit."}

{"doc_id": "79", "text": "In the past five years the percentage of weekly mobile banking users has more than tripled \u2014 from 9% in 2010 to 30% in 2015 \u2014 while weekly branch visitors fell from 40% to 24% in the same time frame. 2015 marked the first time that weekly mobile bankers (30%) exceeded branch bankers (24%) in Javelin\u2019s survey. \u201cWhat is driving this incredible growth? Smartphones and tablets are gaining rapidly in consumer adoption but it\u2019s also a function of the fact that mobile banking services have not only proliferated but increased in the quality and features they offer consumers,\u201d said Javelin analyst Daniel Van Dyke during a January 27 webinar reviewing the firm\u2019s Mobile Banking, Smartphone and Tablet Forecast.\nJavelin\u2019s recent report Digital Account Opening Reaches The Tipping Point also found that more Americans are applying for credit cards, loans and investment products through digital channels than physical ones. Javelin has argued that \u201cFIs that fail to divert resources from branch to digital suffer a large opportunity cost, missing out in lowered servicing costs for basic transactions and in sales of new products.\u201d The service costs argument rings particularly true for mobile deposit, with Chase citing a cost of 65 cents for each teller deposit vs only 3 cents using mobile. While 38 percent of big bank customers utilize mobile deposit, only 18 percent of community bank and 16 percent of credit union customers do, placing these institutions at a significant disadvantage in terms of service costs.\nThe branch network, which peaked at 99,550 U.S. locations in 2009, has dropped each year since. The latest FDIC figure of 93,283 represents a 6.3 percent decline in the last six years, although Bryan Yurcan of American Banker was quick to point out that \"most of that reduction has come with the nation's largest banks shedding inventory ... many smaller banks have held steady, and even increased, branch numbers.\"\nPredicting that account maintenance will increasingly be performed on mobile devices but there will be times that customers seek face-to-face advice, Schwanhausser said FIs need to \"get into the business where they're influencing the behavior of their customers, guiding them to a smarter way to manage their finances. Those are very personal kinds of conversations. It's not about eliminating (the branch) but how do we put the pieces together in a more coherent way?\"\nWhile early adopters of smartwatches tend to be affluent or part of Gen Y2 (ages 25-34), mobile bankers no longer carry such unique characteristics. As Van Dyke put it, \"The mobile banker of today is the banking customer of today. They're becoming indistinguishable.\" Mobile banking has become so commonplace that Javelin projects 80 percent of consumers will be engaging in it \u2014 on a 90 day basis \u2014 by 2020.\nIn 2015 74 percent of mobile banking users employed an app and 69 percent utilized a mobile browser, dwarfing the 31 percent using SMS text messaging. Schwanhausser said FIs will continue to wrestle with the question of what to make available in the app: \"Do you make it fine tuned and focused and streamlined or replicate what can be viewed in online banking?\" Van Dyke predicts that banks will continue to take advantage of device-specific capabilities, whether using the camera for mobile deposit or geolocation to identify nearby ATMs. \"Things like that will underscore the need to offer superior experiences on the app,\" said Van Dyke.\n2015 marked a continuation of Android's dominance, as the operating system grew its share of the U.S. tablet market from 45 to 48 percent and its share of the U.S. smartphone market from 47 to 49 percent. Apple's tablet share fell from 46 to 43 percent, with its smartphone share dropping from 46 to 45 percent. While Apple's numbers have been moving in the wrong direction Van Dyke reiterated that iOS users are the most valuable that an FI can serve. \"iPhone users show extremely unique characteristics. They bank more often, they make payments more often,\" said Van Dyke. \"When it comes to banks and payment providers iPhone owners are the gold standard.\" In addition to serving Android users, Javelin recommended that FIs prioritize an app on Amazon \u2014 but only after all iOS and Android device types have been addressed. Javelin suggested that there was no value in supporting Windows or Blackberry users, who only represent 4 and 2 percent of the smartphone market respectively."}

{"doc_id": "82", "text": "My husband is being posted to Darwin for work and we have decided to drive there. We are going in January and I know this is the wet season. My question is, do you think it will be safe travelling the Stuart Hwy to Darwin in a Holden Sedan at the start of January?\nWe plan on stopping at all the main towns for the night. I just worry about flooding on the Hwy and we are travelling with a child and want to make sure we are doing the right thing.\nJust use common sense. As long as you don't drive into any water deeper than 200mm, and you stick to the road and sealed parking bays (i.e. don't pull off the road into any soft shoulders), there is no problem at all. It's a normal highway.\nOf course there is always a chance of major flooding with the highway being cut by water deeper than that, which means you would have to wait for the water to go down before you can continue your journey.\nIt does happen nearly every year, sometimes more than once, but I really can't predict when and where or for how long. Only Petrus can tell you :-).\nKeep an eye on the weather forecast. Big rains do not come out of nowhere, they come out of big, monsoonal depressions. If one of those is heading for the region, then you may have to reconsider your driving plans.\nAnd of course, always check the road reports.\nHow did the travel go?\nThat must have been a long journey. I am thinking of traveling around Australia one day. How did the travel go?\nIn my opinion traveling from Melbourne to Darwin in January might be a bit uneasy, especially when you are planning to do it without any rescue baggage. There can be flash floods, and within just a matter of seconds the entire highway can become dangerous to travel on. Furthermore, while stopping at major cities for the night is a good idea, it doesn't take you out from the risk of facing floods. And of course, you are not going to like the idea of being stranded on the terrace of a roadside motel till rescue workers pull you guys out. Think over it. I guess you can come up with a better alternative than this.\nEditor's note: I removed your totally unrelated spam link, mate. If your comment wasn't a dead give away that you have never been anywhere near the north, the link certainly was.\nWell, we did it and thankfully had not one problem. There was rain but that stopped our journey because we were lucky enough that the water was off the Ed by the time we reached the apparent flooded areas.... It was a very long drive and all I can say is prepare\u2026 prepare\u2026 prepare. :-) Make sure you have everything you need in case of emergency and you should be fine.... Wishing you safe travels!\nI hope you have a safe trip to Darwin.\nI hope you have a safe trip!\nThat's a long trip you're planning mate, this is what you need: axe, sleeping bag, one huge sack of food, around 30-40 litres of water, some things your kid would like to do, phone, tent, 30-40 litres of oil, torch, 3 knifes, extra tyres (8 tyres), building tools.\nJoin in and write your own page!

{"doc_id": "84", "text": "The Arlington County Board plans to vote Saturday afternoon on giving Amazon $23 million and other incentives to build a headquarters campus in Crystal City, but only after hearing scores of northern Virginia residents and advocates testify for or against the project.\nThe five-member board is expected to support the plan, which was announced amid much hoopla on Nov. 13. The proposed county incentives are part of an agreement in which Amazon would occupy significant office space and bring at least 25,000 high-paying jobs to Arlington in coming years.\nOpponents hope to postpone the vote until after additional public hearings, where they want representatives of the online retail giant to answer questions directly from anyone in the community.\nThe Saturday hearing was scheduled to begin no earlier than 1 p.m. and last several hours before the vote. Ninety-one people signed up in advance to speak on the topic.\nIn the four months since Arlington won a much-publicized, nationwide contest to attract the facility known as HQ2, Arlington residents have been asking questions about its impact on their community.\nPeople have looked at the county\u2019s five online Q&A sessions 14,000 times, and about 400 attended community events to discuss the provisions in the Amazon agreement. Board members and county staff also met with scores of civic organizations, served on multiple panels and appeared on television, online and in news articles to discuss the deal.\nMost Arlingtonians, northern Virginians and residents of the Washington region support Amazon\u2019s arrival, several surveys have found. Business organizations, universities and nonprofit groups came out strongly for the deal.\nBut a small, vocal group of activists has sought to block the project, saying that the county and commonwealth should not give any incentives to one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. They also have demanded housing and job protections for existing residents.\nThese opponents \u2014 including left-wing organizations and immigrants groups \u2014 felt empowered after Amazon canceled plans last month to build a headquarters facility in New York City, also with 25,000 jobs. The company withdrew after criticism of the plan from some elected leaders, unions and community activists.\nIn Virginia, however, such opposition did not appear to catch fire among the broader public.\nOfficials estimate that the Amazon project\u2019s net fiscal impact on Arlington could be worth additional revenue of $162 million over 12 years and $392.5 million over 16 years.\nThe incentives agreement promises the world\u2019s largest online retailer cash grants estimated at about $23 million if it occupies 6.05 million square feet of office space in Crystal City and Pentagon City through 2035.\nThe money would come from an expected increase in the hotel, motel and lodging tax paid by visitors; Amazon would get up to 15 percent of that increase, pegged to how much floor space is in active use by the company each year from 2020 to 2035.\nAmazon\u2019s offices will be located within an already-established special tax district where a portion of the property tax revenue goes toward infrastructure improvements such as parks and wider sidewalks.\nThe incentive agreement says that half of any new revenue from that district starting in 2021 will go specifically toward improvements around the Amazon buildings for the following 10 years. That grant is worth an estimated $28 million but the county says it\u2019s not a grant just for Amazon, because the improvements will benefit other companies in the immediate area. Amazon will have a chance to express its opinion on how the county uses the money, although the board will make the decision.\nThe county also offered Amazon the possibility of using its fast, fiber-optic network connection, which would be the subject of a separate agreement if the company chooses to use it.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether Amazon will pay the local business license tax because that tax is levied only on certain types of business, and Amazon has not yet announced which of its business units will be based in Arlington. If the company does pay the license tax, then some of its operations could be eligible for a discount of up to 72 percent under an existing program designed to attract technology companies.\nWhile Arlington pored over the details, the Virginia General Assembly passed, and Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam signed, an incentives package worth up to $750 million for Amazon."}

{"doc_id": "89", "text": "So you have your children writing every day. Great! Now, of course, you need to become their editor. Here is where some find a challenge in the natural approach to language arts. What if I don\u2019t feel competent to edit my child\u2019s writing? We\u2019ll address the underlying problem with that argument further down, but for now \u2014 here are 10 ways to become a better editor of your child\u2019s writing.\n1. Read A Strong Start in Language.\nThis Ruth Beechick title for beginning grades is recommended widely \u2014 from The Well-Trained Mind to Sonlight. Typically packaged as part of The Three Rs, A Strong Start in Language helps you become the editor from the beginning \u2014 from the time your child traces his first letters, to copywork, and through dictation. Read our full review (scroll down).\n2. Read You Can Teach Your Child Successfully.\nOver 100 pages are devoted to writing in this followup to the Three Rs by Ruth Beechick mentioned above. The book speaks to you as your child\u2019s tutor and therefore includes writing activities, writing lessons to get you started and that you can pattern your own lessons after, and suggestions for usage, grammar, mechanics, and spelling. Best of all it tells you what you can expect from your child at various levels on the writing scale. Very valuable reference to finding your way as you teach writing naturally to your children and we cannot recommend it highly enough. You can read our full review (scroll down).\n3. Use Learning Grammar Through Writing.\nThis handy reference published by Educators Publishing Service is now out of print. But it is worth finding. When you find a mistake in your child\u2019s writing, you can find the coordinating pithy rule with an example to have your child copy into a grammar notebook. A checklist at the back helps you keep track of the skills you have covered.\nThe best way to improve your editing is to read good writing. While you work through the suggestions above, you can be building your foundation in good writing at the same time.\n5. Make use of a dictionary.\nBefore the days of Kindle we had electronic dictionaries handy that included a grammar reference. Although somewhat pricey, the better models not only include the definitions, but also the etymology of the word. Most also come with a built-in thesaurus and other tools. If nothing else, a good dictionary can shed some light on how words are properly used in sentences.\nNot popular with some, but a valuable skill for understanding how words work in sentences. There are easy online courses that can help you quickly learn the basics. For simple and easy practice we like The Complete Book of Diagrams by Mary Daily published by The Riggs Institute Press, which also is a great help for Mom.\n7. Use Learn to Write the Novel Way.\nWhile your child writes his novel as he works through this book, you have a guide that helps you edit your child\u2019s writing. Learn by doing. Read our full review.\n8. Read The Elements of Style.\nThis widely recommended classic by Strunk and White holds the title for the most concise and simple usage, composition, and spelling reference. There is even an early version in the public domain.\n9. Read How to Write Clearly by Ruth Beechick.\nSubtitled, The Meaning Approach, this is another handy writing reference that covers finding a topic, getting organized, outlining, using abstract and concrete terms, sentences, comma usage, active and passive voice, choosing words, usage, and more! Read our full review.\nIt\u2019s never too late. Having a working knowledge of how Latin works is probably one of the best ways to understand how the English language works.\nYou will also want a grammar reference. Our favorite grammar reference is the Handbook of Grammar and Composition published by A Beka. We purchased it on a recommendation in The Well-Trained Mind and haven\u2019t looked back.\nNow, back to the initial question: what if you don\u2019t feel competent to edit your child\u2019s writing? You do know how to write, yes? In this day of streaming output you may even write for a blog or other publication. Using the ideas above, you should be able to stay ahead of your child\u2019s work. Of course, at some point, if you feel you are losing ground there are many qualified and reputable online writing tutors available.\nWhat to have your child do.\nMore structure for those who need it.\nWhere to put the writing.\nYou\u2019ll also want to have your child keep one of these."}

The Pokemon figures are pretty hard to make into a cake so I decided to make the Pokeball, which is just a round ball, half red & half white.\nI\u2019ve been wanting to try my hand at decorating a cake with fondant after washing billions of hours of Charm City Cakes\u2019 amazing creations and \u2018the Cake Boss\u2019. Obviously this would not be anywhere in the same league as the cakes they create, but you have to start somewhere, right?\nI have to say that even after making the fondant, I was still surprised at how heavy it was when it came down to decorating the cake. It\u2019s not like pie dough where you can roll it onto itself and move it. You actually need to decide ahead of time to bring the cake closer to you. I found this out after having finally kneaded the fondant so it was just right and then rolling it to just the right thickness and then trying to get it to my cake\u2026 And having it rip apart and fall on the floor\u2026 Thus having to start all over with a new piece. And I did this TWICE before moving the cake. Ugh. Sometimes my brain doesn\u2019t work!\nAnyway, once I moved the cake and got a feel for the fondant, it went pretty smoothly.\nThen I went to add the final touches, which I thought would be the easiest part\u2026 I had that icing in a can with the writing tips. That\u2019s what I used for the black lines I needed. It came out in globs and made a mess. Then I tried to \u2018fix\u2019 it by making another line so maybe it would look like it was supposed to be thicker. It looked awful! Oh well. It was black, it\u2019s not like I could take it back off and start over (the fondant instantly took on the color!). I decided to just be happy the fondant worked.\nBut then, because I can\u2019t just leave well enough alone, I had to write on the cake. I used that same icing in a can, this time in blue. Maybe it\u2019s just me. I don\u2019t think I can write on cakes. The writing was awful and I was very upset about it. I do have a really nice set of cake decorating tips so next time I\u2019ll see if I can do any better with the decorations using homemade icing.\nThe actual cake was just a white box cake, I made a blue and a green layer and then I cut each layer in two so it would be a 4-layer cake. I made a delicious vanilla buttercream to frost it. I also added a layer of sprinkles :). I wish I could post a pic of the inside but it was so late after trick-or-treating last night, it never got cut!\nI think I\u2019m going to go eat the leftover vanilla buttercream!"}

Can you imagine the paparazzi crowding into a women's restroom with her?\nAfter watching her last show rater intently (and knowing it's a glossy over produced Kartrashian show) I couldn't see the emotion in Jenner. Again, I don't know all the facts about her, except she went out and bought the best plastic surgery money could buy. Again, maybe that's why I can't see any emotion in her face-she can't move it!!!!\nPlus, I have no idea how long she has been back on HRT. It took me three years on hormones to begin to see the world in a different way. When I watch Jenner, I wonder if she has passed over (no pun intended) to the feminine side much at all. She tries to overtalk most people and doesn't want to listen for the real problems-typical male.\nThen again, maybe I am just watching the true quandary of a Mtf gender transition play out with Jenner.

Either there is one single state of Europe (federalism), in which case there are no national member states; or else the national member states remain Europe\u2019s rulers, in which case there is no Europe (inter-governmentalism). Within this framework of thought, whatever Europe gains, the individual nations lose. And this is true whether one is for a given option or against it. Caught up in the false alternatives of the national gaze, we are given the choice between no Europe or no Europe.\nThe decline of the nation-state is really a decline of the specifically national content of the state and an opportunity to create a cosmopolitan state system that is better able to deal with the problems that all nations face in the world today. Economic globalisation, transnational terrorism, global warming: the litany is familiar and daunting. There are a host of problems that are clearly beyond the power of the old order of nation-states to cope with. The answer to global problems that are gathering ominously all around and that refuse to yield to nation-state solutions is for politics to take a quantum leap from the nation-state system to the cosmopolitan state system. Politics needs to regain credibility in order to craft real solutions.\nMore than anywhere else in the world, Europe shows that this step is possible. Europe teaches the modern world that the political evolution of states and state systems is by no means at an end. National realpolitik is becoming unreal, not only in Europe, but throughout the world. It is turning into a lose-lose game.\nEuropeanisation means creating a new politics. It means entering as a player into the meta-power game, into the struggle to form the rules of a global order. The catchphrase for the future might be: move over America, Europe is back.\nThe EU uses money for things that the various countries governments would not dream of spending it on, such as regional projects, culture, the arts and so on. The governments would probably just use that money to bail out banks.."}

FH Pro Omega 3 contains the fats you need to support optimal reproductive health and fertility.\nFH-Pro Omega 3 for Men and Women contains oil only from small fish, including herring, mackerel, sardines and anchovies, caught in the cold water of Iceland using sustainable fishing practices. The EPA and DHA-rich oil is then processed in a GMP (good manufacturing practices)-compliant facility to remove heavy metals and pesticides, resulting in premium quality fish oil that is pharmaceutical grade and meets or exceeds all official regulations related to environmental contaminants.\nI have been trying to concieve for years and have tried different omega-3\u2019s. This one is small and doesn\u2019t leave a bad after taste. I wouldn\u2019t use any other brand, I love it!\none of the better i\u2019ve found, they are pretty small and don\u2019t have a bad aftertaste like most others."}
{"doc_id": "114", "text": "Mahatma Gandhi1 once said, \u201cThe world provides enough for every man\u2019s need but not for every man\u2019s greed.\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s easy to agree with proclamations of world peace and say things like, \u201cThe rich should really give to the poor and solve world hunger!\u201d However, when the giving strikes closer to home, it can be tougher than we think.\nI once had a watch that I thought was seriously cool. It was a boy\u2019s watch, but I didn\u2019t mind; it had all the dials and gadgets you could want. I visited my family and my younger brother was crazy about my watch and asked if he could have it. I told him I couldn\u2019t possibly part with such amazingness and sadly left it at that. Shortly after getting home, my treasured watch met with an accident and broke. It was then that I realized how stupid it was that I\u2019d missed the opportunity to give it to my little brother, who was so much more important to me than that watch ever could be. It might not have lasted him forever either, but at least he would have been happy for a while. And more than the watch, the meaning behind my giving him something special would have stuck with him so much longer.\nI try to remember that incident whenever I\u2019m tempted to be selfish with my things or start to prize them too highly. It\u2019s great to have nice things and groovy gadgets. (Don\u2019t tell anyone, but I\u2019m fairly addicted to my phone, which contains all my appointments, mail, reminders, to-do lists, Facebook, Twitter, Messenger, Google, and favorite games.) These days, the \u201cmust-have\u201d gadgets are endless\u2014from smartphones, iPads, laptops, and gaming equipment right down to 3D home TVs! If you\u2019re able to have some of these nice things and enjoy them and they help you with your work and studies, or are also a fun source of entertainment, technology can be great. But it\u2019s good to step back sometimes and imagine what it would be like if one day all those things instantly disappeared. After your initial withdrawal symptoms, you\u2019d realize that life goes on without material things. What matters most are our loved ones\u2014our friends and family members. Sometimes we can forget this truth, and that\u2019s when we tend to act selfishly.\nThe act of giving not only helps those we give to, but us as well. Luke 6:38 says, \u201cGive, and it will be given to you.\u201d2 Sometimes what you get back will be something tangible, such as the Lord supplying things you need or someone giving to you, but more often than not what you receive in return is the satisfaction that you did something good. Have you ever given someone something they really needed or wanted and watched their face light up? It\u2019s an amazing feeling!\nAn old American movie from the 1930s called The Man Who Played God is about a concert pianist who lost his hearing in a bomb explosion. He finally got through his depression when he learned how to read lips. He\u2019d watch people in Central Park (New York City), where they\u2019d talk about their problems and troubles, and he would do what he could to solve their problems anonymously. I think it would be amazing to do something like that, to know what other people need and be able to secretly give it to them.\nThere is a cute kids\u2019 song that one or two of you may have heard when you were knee high to a grasshopper, called, \u201cI\u2019d Like to Be Invisible.\u201d The singer wishes he was invisible so that he could \u201cspread love everywhere, and help in secret ways without you knowing he was there.\u201d (Yup, it even rhymed!) The truest part of the song, though, is where it concludes that you don\u2019t have to be invisible, because you can do things to make a difference all around you. You can make it a point to look for where the need is and do what you can to fill it.\nIt\u2019s a funny story but it rings true. It\u2019s easy for me to think that if I had a million dollars, I\u2019d love to give it away to help people, or to ponder all the great things I\u2019d do for my family with money like that; but when it comes to giving away a small portion of my free time to parents who could use a break from their kids, or doing a favor that costs me in the here and now, that\u2019s where the true essence of giving really kicks in.\nI know a lot of missionaries who do great works of evangelism and charity, and it\u2019s inspiring to read about the orphanages they help and the seminars they host, and all the other great projects they do. However, I have a very personal description of what makes a missionary: it\u2019s someone with a giving heart. That means not only do they do big, impressive (and usually well-advertised) works to help the poor or disadvantaged, but they\u2019re also always there to lend a helping hand whenever there is a need. They give to their own hurt; and they don\u2019t ask for or expect favors in return. They don\u2019t have a personal agenda. They just give. And you can feel their love and kindness in their actions. They\u2019re the ones you only ask for help when you really need it, because you know they\u2019ll do everything in their power to help you. In return, you want to do anything you can to help them. Their lives are examples of cheerful and selfless giving.\nI would love to be remembered as someone like that! Sure, we all have bouts of selfishness, and human nature tends to take the path of least resistance, but it\u2019s something to strive for, don\u2019t you think? Sometimes giving can be as simple as a sincere compliment, a hug, or a word of appreciation. It can also be giving your favorite gizmo to your little brother or sister when it would mean the world to them.\n3 Kahlil Gibran (January 6, 1883\u2013April 10, 1931) was a Lebanese artist, poet, and writer."}

These encounters aren\u2019t as straightforward as all that, they involve a reflection on the ways we approach strangeness but also, sometimes, associating with adversity. How can we speak with what we have identified as the language of the enemy? How can we cross the border between apparently opposing positions, not to reconcile them in the fantasised about myth of the consensual community, but to enrich the ways we apprehend adversity and our methods of conflictual interaction which, don\u2019t forget, are the basis of all democracy.

{"doc_id": "124", "text": "HOW do we explain why 5.5m French voters in the first round of the presidential elections voted for far-right parties that are xenophobic, anti-semitic, racist and ultra-nationalist? Sounding off about the wrongness of the vote will not help understand the reasons underlying their choice. Everybody in politics needs to begin an urgent, thorough and much-needed self-criticism.\nThe vote may have been a valuable wake-up call for France if it opens the eyes of party leaders and revives the debate on how to build a nation based on justice and solidarity. What vanished in April was the comforting thought that although everything was changing in the world outside, in French politics everything could stay the same; that two ageing parties, the Gaullists and the Socialists, could share power as they had done for 30 years.\nPeople have sensed for some time that these two political forces are worn out. Their historic mission seems to have ended. Each in its own way gives the impression of an organisation going nowhere, with crumbling infrastructures, no organisation or programme, no ideology, no identity and no compass for the journey ahead.\nPrevious elections had already shown that neither party was capable of addressing the needs of millions of people who are genuinely frightened by the new realities of the post-industrial world that has emerged after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the end of the cold war. The disposable workers, the underclasses of the banlieues, the long-term unemployed, the excluded, the many people pushed into early retirement, the young people in precarious jobs, the families on the brink of poverty. For all these, the recent past has brought years of fear and anxiety, with many familiar landmarks apparently gone forever.\nThe Socialist party in particular, with almost no working-class people in its local organisations and several leaders in the supertax bracket, gives the impression that it lives on another planet, light years from the experiences of ordinary people. It has shown itself remarkably insensitive to what Daniel Mermet describes as \u201cthe sufferings of under-France\u201d.\nWhat about the right? Some conservative politicians see the far right as untouchable, but others have been happy to do electoral deals with it. The former liberal leader, Michel Poniatowski, recently wondered in public whether it was \u201cany more immoral to accept the votes of communists, who murdered millions of people in Europe, than those of the National Front\u201d (1). This perverse logic allowed Christian Democrat leaders of the Union pour la d\u00e9mocratie fran\u00e7aise (UDF) to accept National Front votes in 1998 to be elected to the presidency of five French regions.\nWhile this plague infected the inner workings of France\u2019s political institutions, was it reasonable to imagine that France would remain immune to the upsurge of far-right politics in its immediate neighbours (see Fascism isn\u2019t what it used to be, by Jean-Yves Camus, in this issue)? Or likely that France would be the exception when, like other European countries, its social fabric has been violently rent in the name of modernity: by liberalism and globalisation, European unification, the decline in national sovereignty, the abandonment of the franc, the disappearance of national borders, the hegemony of the United States, multiculturalism, loss of identity and the crisis of the welfare state?\nAll this happened in the context of the end of the industrial era and technological transformations that led to widespread economic insecurity and terrible social malaise. In such a context, with competition raised to the status of a natural imperative, an increase in violence and criminality was inevitable. The abruptness and brutality of these changes meant that uncertainties are accumulating as horizons have been lost, the world seems less clear, and history appears to defy logic and understanding. Ordinary people have felt abandoned by governments of both right and left; unsurprisingly, since the press describes them as corrupt, as liars and cheats.\nMany people feel lost and panicky; as Tocqueville put it,\"since the past no longer illuminates the present, the human spirit walks in darkness\". Old magicians have returned to conjure with this new obscurantism, this breeding-ground of fear, confusion and resentment. Their rhetoric is demagogic, authoritarian and racist; they talk of a return to the old values (work, family, motherland) and blame foreigners, Arabs and Jews for all the disorders, social problems and insecurities. Immigrants are an easy target, always available, because they symbolise social upheavals, and among the lowest-income earners they are seen as unwanted competition.\nAlthough it is absurd, hateful and even criminal, the rhetoric of the National Front has long appealed to more than one in four French people according to the opinion polls (2). On 21 April it gained the electoral approval of millions (30% of the unemployed, 24% of workers, 20% of young people and 17% of employers).\nThe Republican awakening expressed in street demonstrations all over France translated into anti-Le Pen votes on 5 May. Neo-fascism will not be voted in during the parliamentary elections in June either. But once the moment of fear has passed, if the parties carry on as before, with privatisation, dismantling public services, creating pension funds and accepting sackings to keep shareholders happy, if they continue to deny people\u2019s desires for a society that is fairer, more fraternal, more based on solidarity \u2014 then there is no guarantee that fascism, in alliance with the usual collaborators, will not win next time.\n(1) Lib\u00e9ration, 20 March 1998.\n(2) Le Monde, 13 April 1996."}

Our bodies thrive on raw plant-based foods. I think this is why our creator made fruits and vegetables look soo enticing! Asking yourself \u201cHow can I get this more of these beauties into my diet?\u201d Then follow me over the next few weeks because I will be preparing raw plant-based recipes. Summer is the best time to set started \u2013 you\u2019ll beat the heat (in and out of the kitchen) and eat seasonally at the same time!\nThis beautiful summer salad will brighten up any meal. Great with peaches or try cherries, nectarines or plums!\nOver the years, I have been trying to incorporate more raw foods into my diet and here\u2019s why: I want to stay feeling and looking young, and free of disease. Plant-based foods are the best sources of disease-fighting antioxidants, inflammation-fighting polyphenols, and a host of nourishing vitamins and minerals and I want to load my body up with that protective goodness!\nBut a completely raw diet can be complicated and expensive. And I am a busy, working mom who\u2019s a foodie, to boot. My goal is to find ways to easily prepare and enjoy more live raw food as a way of adding more healing nourishment into my diet. You don\u2019t have to eat 100% raw to feel the energizing benefits. But it does take a shift in how and what foods you prepare. All you need is a little know-how to get started. Here are the steps that I took to get started.\nIt\u2019s tempting to make a drastic dietary change because we just want to feel better NOW. I commend your enthusiasm but remember, it is better to start small and follow through, then go big and get overwhelmed and give up. Choose one thing and stick with it. Try adding a green smoothie to your morning routine or swapping out your regular lunch for a big, raw salad. Once you\u2019ve made this first step a part of your routine, add something else. These little steps will lead to big health changes over time.\nWhen starting a new way of eating, it\u2019s common to focus on what you are losing. Instead, concentrate on what power foods you can add to enhance the nutritional value of each meal. Eating more plant-based foods may encourage you to experiment with different cuisines, along with new herbs and spices. Yum, yum! Don\u2019t worry about what you\u2019ll need to give up. Focus on what you\u2019re gaining: flavor, nutrition and energy.\nNo need to over-complicate and feel stressed out! Start by sticking to the basics: smoothies, soups, salads, slaws. Over time, you will expand your collection of delicious, healthful, amazing raw plant-based recipes.\nFind a day that works for you and take 30-40 minutes to prepare your fruits and veggies for the week ahead. Grate veggies (carrots, radishes, zucchini) for salads. Cut and freeze fruit for smoothies. Make staples to keep on hand (salad dressings, hummus, cooked grains). A little work today will help you make healthier choices all week long!\nIdeally, every Sunday you have all of your meals planned and veggies prepped. Sound too hard? Start by planning two or three recipes for the week. I like to keep a folder of \u201crecipes to try\u201d in my kitchen for inspiration. Save time with leftovers and always keep raw snacks like nuts and apples with you. A little planning does the trick!\nHere is a salad to get you started: it can be used for a side at dinner or bring it the next day for lunch by adding it to a wrap with hummus. It will keep nicely and actually tastes better the next day!\nSo try adding some raw, plant-based dishes to your meal plan this week! I\u2019ll be back next week with some more ideas and delicious recipes to help you moving forward towards a healthier, plant-based, deliciously raw table!"}

{"doc_id": "128", "text": "When it comes to divorce in Salt Lake City, each party has a lot to lose\u2013especially if you have children or significant assets. One of the most complex issues is the division of assets and property. Utah law requires the distribution to be equitable. In many divorce cases, both parties are unable to agree how to divide property and assets. It can often create an acrimonious situation. An experienced and knowledgeable Salt Lake City divorce lawyer can often make the difference between getting the settlement you deserve to losing everything you have rightfully earned.\nIn most Utah divorces, there are three major assets that are usually involved\u2013the home, personal property and retirement plans/investments. Here is a brief rundown on how Utah courts determine equitable asset and property division.\nHome & Property: Many of the most heated divorce cases in Salt Lake City involve which party is entitled to receive the home. The court can use several different methods of determination. Here are the most common depending on the circumstances of each case. First, the court may order the house to be sold and equity divided among the two parties. The court may also allow one party to buy out the other person\u2019s interest in the real property. Another common ruling is to have the property awarded to one party and the remaining assets of equal value given to the other.\nPersonal Property: Personal property is classified as the ownership of any material possessions that can be moved. It includes cars, furniture, and clothing. While most people do not share clothes, the determination of vehicles and furniture can sometimes become complex\u2013especially if they are co-owned by each party. Utah courts place a priority on dividing personal property equitably.\nRetirement Plans & Investments: The division of retirement and investment accounts can sometimes get complicated under Utah family law. If only one party has a pension or retirement plan, in most cases the other party is entitled to half of the amount earned during the time of the marriage. Any money earned before the marriage will not be divided. If both parties have their names on investment or retirement plans, the court can rule either two ways. Both individuals can retain the full value of their own plans or the court will order an equitable distribution of all accounts.\nIn a perfect world, divorcing couples can agree to divide assets and property on their own. Unfortunately, that is not always the case. But there are some solutions to come up with a reasonable agreement. One viable option is mediation. Many Salt Lake City divorce attorneys offer mediation services to help couples find common ground on some of the most difficult family law issues. Under Utah family law, both parties are required to undergo at least one mediation session to attempt to resolve their differences. A mediator is an independent arbitrator who can listen to both sides explain their issues and concerns. It is often a less stressful alternative to court is also far less expensive than going through the conventional divorce process.\nTo learn more about your options concerning the division of assets and property, contact Salt Lake City divorce attorney Emy A. Cordano for a consultation today."}

{"doc_id": "133", "text": "The Eastern Playoff race has been decided. The Carolina Hurricanes have drawn the first wildcard spot and will face the Metropolitan Division-leading Washington Capitals in the first round of the playoffs. The New York Islanders will be the second seed in the Metro and will have to square off against the Pittsburgh Penguins. In the Atlantic Division, the Columbus Blue Jackets end up with a tough match-up as they will face the Tampa Bay Lightning, while the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs will meet once again, as everyone has known about for quite some time. The final results of the night will determine how the Western Conference Shakes out.\nThe Colorado Avalanche\u2019s Mikko Rantanen was spotted on the ice Saturday in San Jose wearing a non-contact jersey, according to The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark. The injured forward, who hasn\u2019t seen action since March 21st with an undisclosed injury, traveled with the team but will sit out once again. While that doesn\u2019t sound like great news, considering the playoffs are right around the corner it is better to have him skating than not. If Colorado has any chance of advancing out of the first round, they will need their young scorer. The 22-year-old will have played eight less games than last year, but has a career high 31 goals and 87 points in his sophomore season. Avalanche head coach Jared Bednar said later today that he is hopeful that Rantanen will be available for the playoffs, according to BSN\u2019s Adrian Dater.\nSpeaking of injuries, the Pittsburgh Penguins got some good news as defenseman Brian Dumoulin skated on his own after missing the past three games with a lower-body injury, according to Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Dumoulin, who normally skates alongside Kris Letang, would make a big impact on a lineup that is preparing for the playoffs and could use the player tied for fifth in the NHL with a +31 rating. \u201cThe fact that Dumo is on the ice is really encouraging from our standpoint,\u201d Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. He added that the injury isn\u2019t considered major and Doumolin remains day-to-day.\nThe St. Louis Blues expect to get back defenseman Colton Parayko, who has sat out the past two games with an undisclosed injury. The 25-year-old defender is expected to play in the playoffs, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch\u2019s Jim Thomas. Thomas added that Tyler Bozak was just held out for precautionary reasons Saturday after he was in a car accident getting to the game. The veteran center was rear-ended, but wasn\u2019t seriously hurt. He too is expected back for the playoff opener.\nAs the Blackhawks pass through another disappointing season, the team must continue to focus on development. The team has a nice group of prospects coming up the pipeline, but there are many that are starting to worry about whether the Blackhawks are doing the right thing with defenseman Henri Jokiharju, their 2017 first-rounder.\nThe Blackhawks, not known for developing defensemen recently, loaned Jokiharju out to Finland for the World Junior Championships, against the youngster\u2019s wishes even though they eventually won the gold medal. Since his return, the team has changed course in his development, moving him over to the left side, his off-side which will help make room next season for right-hand shot Adam Boqvist, and has had his ice-time cut, according to The Athletic\u2019s Scott Powers (subscription required). He even was a healthy scratch recently.\nHead coach Jeremy Colliton said the changes are being made to make sure the youngster won\u2019t burn out like many rookies do during their first season.\nThe Colorado Avalanche suffered a key loss Saturday as the team will be without defenseman Erik Johnson, who suffered a concussion during their game against Los Angeles. The veteran defenseman is expected to be out for the next two games and head coach Jared Bednar hopes he\u2019ll be back after the All-Star break, according to The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark. The defensive-minded blueliner averages 21:42 of ATOI and is a key figure on the team\u2019s defense.\nThe Avalanche also had good news in practice as defensive prospect Conor Timmins, who has missed all of the 2018-19 season so far with a concussion, practiced today with the team even if it was in a non-contact jersey, according to BSN\u2019s AJ Haefele. Bednar said after the practice that Timmins will begin ramping up activities over the next couple of weeks and they will see if he\u2019s ready to go when the team returns after the All-Star break. Timmins, the team\u2019s second-round pick in 2017, could help the team down the stretch if he\u2019s deemed ready.\nTed Wyman of the Winnipeg Sun looks back at the first half of the season now that the team hits their bye and All-Star week, suggesting that while many things have gone right for the Jets, perhaps the most disappointing part of the season has been the play of star forward Patrik Laine. The scribe writes that the third-year winger is having a miserable season despite having 25 goals at this point. Despite an 18-goal November, Laine has tallied just seven goals combined in the other three months and often looks like a rookie on the ice. Of course, he\u2019s only 20 years old still, so patience is needed.\nAfter struggling for much of the season and recently seeing his ice time dwindle, Tyson Jost is headed back to the AHL. The Colorado Avalanche today assigned Jost and Ryan Graves to the Colorado Eagles, giving them just 21 players on the roster.\nJost, 20, was the tenth overall pick in 2016 but has yet to really establish himself in the NHL. After a great freshmen season at the University of North Dakota, the offensive center signed his entry-level contract and made his debut down the stretch for the Avalanche. Last year he returned to the lineup full-time and recorded 22 points in 65 games, but has failed to really take a step forward in 2018-19. Jost hasn\u2019t been asked to play center on a regular basis this season given his struggles in the faceoff circle, and it\u2019s not clear exactly where he fits into the lineup in a perfect scenario.\nThat fit will have to be determined through his play in the minor leagues, as the young forward was clearly not progressing in the NHL. In 43 games he has just 15 points, despite being given ample opportunities on the powerplay for much of the year. Given that he does not penalty kill and is seeing fewer than ten minutes of even-strength ice time in recent weeks, playing in a top-six role for the Eagles is probably the best for his development. Jost can obviously be recalled at a moment\u2019s notice given the proximity of the AHL team, and currently does not require waivers.\nGraves meanwhile could be back up before the Avalanche hit the ice on Saturday against the Los Angeles Kings, but he too had been used extremely sparingly by head coach Jared Bednar during his time in the NHL. The 23-year old defenseman has logged fewer than 12 minutes of ice time in each of his eight appearances, though he does have two goals already to show for his short NHL career.\nPoll: Should Colorado Move Semyon Varlamov?\nThe Colorado Avalanche returned third-string goalie Pavel Francouz to the AHL today. Yet, at this point in their season, it is fair to ask whether that move actually makes the team better. The Avs finally snapped a six-game win-less streak on Friday night against the New York Rangers and have fallen out of the once-competitive Central Division race over the past month. Colorado\u2019s struggles are not singular in nature \u2013 a lack of secondary scoring and a struggling penalty kill have played a part \u2013 but poor performance in net has been the most pressing issue facing the team. After a hot start to the season, Semyon Varlamov has regressed to a .912 save percentage and 2.80 GAA and has missed the team\u2019s past two games with a lower-body injury. Off-season acquisition Philipp Grubauer has yet to settle in with Colorado, holding a career-worst .902 save percentage and 3.13 GAA thus far.\nConsidering that Varlamov\u2019s play is not currently winning games for the Avalanche, the team could opt to move on from the veteran keeper. Despite Varlamov\u2019s recent slump, the impending unrestricted free agent would still be a valued name on the trade market as the NHL Trade Deadline grows closer. Several teams will be looking for a rental for the stretch run and postseason and Varlamov could potentially be the closest thing to a bona fide starter that could hit the market. Why then would the playoff-bound Avalanche want to move Varlamov if he\u2019s still a top NHL option? The return would be substantial and could \u2013 either directly or by flipping part of the return \u2013 result in Colorado adding the forward depth they so desperately need. It was recently reported that the Avs are hesitant to move their top prospects and young roster players for help, which could force them to move an established veteran like Varlamov.\nThe Avalanche could benefit from some addition by subtraction when it comes to Varlamov as well. The aforementioned Francouz, in his first season in North America after an illustrious European career, has made the transition look easy this season. Recently named an AHL All-Star, Francouz, 28, has a .919 save percentage and 2.65 GAA through 23 games with the Colorado Eagles. Perhaps more impressively, Francouz has made two NHL relief appearances and has saved 33 of the 35 shots that he faced (.943 SV%). The Denver Post\u2019s Sean Keeler writes that head coach Jared Bednar considered making Francouz the starter over Grubauer last night and opined that the current third-string could be the X-factor for the Avs this season. Francouz is also an impending UFA and the team should take a longer look at him this season to determine if he could be a long-term option alongside Gruabauer. An extended stay in Denver this season would certainly help convince Francouz to stick around as well.\nOf course, if the Avalanche were to trade Varlamov this season, it would very likely hurt their chances at a Stanley Cup title. Despite his struggles, Varlamov has outplayed Grubauer and has years of success to fall back on, as opposed to his young backup and Francouz, an unproven import. Colorado would likely have to turn around and add another option in net if they were to trade Varlamov. However, given that the Avs face a probable playoff route through the Nashville Predators and Winnipeg Jets this season, it could be that they favor improving the team for the future rather than clinging to slim title chances. The team could also feel that addressing their needs at forward is a priority compared to maintaining depth in net.\nWhat do you think? Should the Avalanche change things up by trading Varlamov for young pieces or forward help and hand the reins to Grubauer and Francouz? Or should they hold on to their established starter in hopes that it is their best chance at a Cup run this season?\nThe Colorado Avalanche announced they have recalled goaltender Pavel Francouz from the Colorado Eagles of the AHL. Head coach Jared Bednar said that Semyon Varlamov was a little banged up and Francouz was recalled as a precaution. The 28-year-old was up earlier this month and was impressive in a relief stint on Dec. 22 when he saved 21 of 22 shots against Arizona in 29 minutes of work. Francouz, who signed as a free agent with Colorado in the offseason out of the KHL has performed well in the AHL as well, posting a 13-7-1 record and a .919 save percentage. With Varlamov expected to hit free agency at the end of the season, Francouz could be a strong candidate to fill the backup role next season.\nThe Carolina Hurricanes have assigned forward Janne Kuokkanen to the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL, according to CapFriendly. The 20-year-old prospect has had trouble finding a positive role with the Hurricanes, despite being dominant in the AHL. Kuokkanen has yet to score in seven games and has seen his playing time dwindle to under 10 minutes in the past three games. He will return to Charlotte where he has already equaled his goal output from last year and can continue working on his game. The team followed that up announcing the promotion of Saku Maenalanen from Charlotte to fill Kuokkanen\u2019s shoes. Maenalanen has appeared in just one game for the Hurricanes, but has scored seven goals and 14 points in 31 games for the Checkers.\nWhile it\u2019s already been reported that the Chicago Blackhawks\u2019 recent trade acquisition Jason Garrison cleared waivers earlier today, NBC Sports Charlie Roumeliotis reports that Blackhawks\u2019 general manager Stan Bowman said Garrison will be assigned to the Rockford Ice Hogs of the AHL. Garrison, picked up in Sunday\u2019s trade with Drake Caggulia for Brandon Manning, has played in 17 games with the Oilers this year. He did play 58 games with the Chicago Wolves last season when playing for the Vegas franchise.\nAfter two years in the Swiss League, former NHLer Bobby Sanguinetti has returned to North America, as the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL announced they have signed the 30-year-old veteran to an AHL deal. The defenseman, who played 45 games with the New York Rangers and Carolina Hurricanes, played with the Checkers for three years before spending the last two years in Switzerland. Sanguinetti, a former first-round pick in 2006, will hope to resurrect his career there.\nThe Nashville Predators announced they have assigned Nicholas Baptiste to the Milwaukee Admirals of the AHL. The team recalled him Monday to serve as an emergency player for their game against Washington, but now have returned the 23-year-old without getting him into a game. Baptiste has played 34 games for Milwaukee and has six goals and 14 points.\nThe Minnesota Wild have recalled defenseman Ryan Murphy from AHL Iowa per a team release. This will be the 25-year-old\u2019s first stint in the NHL this season but he has 172 games of NHL experience between Carolina and Minnesota over the past six seasons. Murphy has played in 27 games in the minors this season with three goals and 10 assists.\nThe Colorado Avalanche went out of its way to bring in goaltender Philipp Grubauer via trade during the offseason to be their heir apparent in goal, but with Semyon Varlamov playing well throughout this season, Grubauer hasn\u2019t had much of a chance to claim that role. However, that might be changing.\nWith the team having lost five of their last seven games and Varlamov struggling, the team got a brilliant performance from Grubauer on Tuesday as he saved 35 shots in a 2-1 win over the Montreal Canadiens. After that performance, The Athletic\u2019s Ryan S. Clark (subscription required) wonders if this is the turning point where Grubauer takes over as the team\u2019s No. 1 goaltender. With Varlamov slated to hit unrestricted free agency this summer, the team needs for Grubauer to take that next step and that looks to be the case. In the last six starts (not including Friday\u2019s 2-1 loss to Chicago), the 27-year-old is 5-0-1 with a 2.29 GAA and a .936 save percentage.\n\u201c(Grubauer) gives us a chance. He gives us a real good chance,\u201d head coach Jared Bednar said. \u201cHe keeps it at 1-0 and guys are saying the right things on the bench. \u2026 I just felt like he looked really solid in the net. Like he was in control tonight. I haven\u2019t felt that way about our goaltending for the last little bit and that\u2019s what we need.\nThe Athletic\u2019s Scott Powers (subscription required) writes that when winger Brendan Perlini was traded from the Arizona Coyotes to Chicago Blackhawks, he had high hopes that a change of scenery would jumpstart his career as he has struggled to put up points. However, while the Blackhawks liked what they have seen from center Dylan Strome, Perlini quickly found himself on the team\u2019s fourth line and even found himself a healthy scratch early on. \u201cTo be honest, you never like to sit, but it\u2019s good because I can watch the game and say, OK, here\u2019s certain spots where maybe I can get the puck or things like that or realize watching I can settle down there, there\u2019s a lot more time than I actually think. Like I said, you never like watching, but you can take good things from it. I think I\u2019ve done that and just try to build off it and learn every day.\u201d Perlini since then has looked much more comfortable and has picked up a couple of goals in the past four games. The hope is he continues to make adjustments in Chicago\u2019s lineup.\nKen Wiebe of the Winnipeg Sun writes that with the impressive play shown by Winnipeg Jets\u2019 goaltender Laurent Brossoit can be attributed back to last year when the back-up lost his job in Edmonton to Al Montoya and he found himself in the AHL for the remainder of the season. That experience made him work harder to get back to the NHL. \u201cNow I\u2019m more aware of who I am as a goalie and as a professional, if that makes any sense,\u201d said Brossoit. \u201cIt was unfortunate I had to go through those growing pains during my biggest opportunity with that club. I wouldn\u2019t say that I performed at the level I normally do.\u201d Brossoit was offered to return to Edmonton, but instead opted to start fresh in Winnipeg.\nThe NHL has issued a $2,000 fine to Colorado Avalanche forward Mikko Rantanen, citing two instances in which he broke Rule 64 for Diving/Embellishment this season. Fines will increase for Rantanen for any subsequent instances, and eventually include financial punishment to head coach Jared Bednar as well. The first incident, which garnered just a warning, was on October 16th against the New York Rangers, while the latest was during a November 14th game against the Boston Bruins.\nRantanen has been one of the league\u2019s brightest stars this season and still leads the entire NHL in scoring with 32 points. His play alongside Nathan MacKinnon has been a revelation, and has the Avalanche poised to become one of the league\u2019s most dangerous offensive teams. Unfortunately with this history, he\u2019ll now be watched even more closely by the officials and may not get the benefit of the doubt on close calls. He also could very well draw the ire of his coaching staff if he causes them to be fined, or costs his team with an ill-timed penalty.\nWith a dominant top line that includes Nathan MacKinnon, Gabriel Landeskog and Mikko Rantanen, the Colorado Avalanche can\u2019t be happier as they have combined for 75 points so far this season. However, the biggest concern for the team has been their secondary scoring, which most recently seems to have improved when the team re-inserted center Tyson Jost together with wingers Alex Kerfoot and Colin Wilson, according to Kyle Newman of the Denver Post.\nJost had spent some time with that line earlier this year, but between a demotion to the team\u2019s fourth line and an injury that kept him out for four games, Jost finally got a chance to center the two wingers and has made the most of his opportunity with a pair of goals in the past week as well as improved play from both Wilson and Kerfoot."}

{"doc_id": "136", "text": "Considering last fall\u2019s wet weather and the soggy fields this spring, farmers wonder about using inoculants on soybean seed in 2010. Should you use a rhizobium inoculant? Or, is there enough of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria, Bradyrhizobia japonicum, remaining in the soil?\nTrue, rhizobial bacteria don\u2019t survive wet conditions very well. But whether it will pay to use an inoculant depends largely on whether soybeans were grown in the field sometime during the last five years or if the field has been flooded for more than a week, says Aaron Saeugling, Iowa State University Extension field agronomist in southwest Iowa.\nThe presence of rhizobia in the soil is necessary for a legume such as soybeans to be able to convert nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form usable by the plant, he says. This process, nitrogen fixation, is critical for producing high soybean yields. For nitrogen fixation to occur, the nitrogen-fixing bacteria need to be readily available in the soil or must be applied to the seed.\nWhen soybean seed germinates, the rhizobia bacteria invade the root hairs of the seedling and begin to multiply. Nodules, the structures that house the bacteria, form on the roots. Under field conditions, nodule formation can be seen shortly after emergence, but active nodule fixation of N from the air doesn\u2019t begin until about the V2 to V3 growth stage of beans. After that point, the number of nodules formed and amount of nitrogen fixed increase with time until about midway between the R5 and R6 growth stages; then N fixation decreases sharply.\nApplying nitrogen fertilizer for soybeans isn\u2019t recommended because it typically doesn\u2019t increase bean yields in Iowa production systems. The total number of nodules that form decreases with increasing amounts of applied N.\nToday, most fields in the Midwest have had soybeans grown on them in the crop rotation, likely increasing population density of Bradyrhizobia bacteria in the soil, notes Saeugling. Improved inoculant technology, coupled with higher commodity prices, ease of application and relatively low-cost inoculant products, have many growers reconsidering the use of inoculants.\nSince 2003, ISU agronomists have conducted trials each year to assess new inoculants on the market. Overall, the ISU studies haven\u2019t shown a consistent yield response to use of soybean inoculants in fields in Iowa with a history of having soybeans grown on them.\nCurrent recommendations for Iowa are to inoculate the seed if a field has never been planted to soybeans, or if beans haven\u2019t been grown in the field for the past three to five years. Other situations where it\u2019s recommended to inoculate are if soil pH is below 6.0, or if a field has sandy soil, or if a field has been flooded for more than a week, creating anaerobic conditions.\nRising cost of production and volatile commodity prices are driving the need for soybean growers to improve profits. But the use of inoculants to increase yield may not be the answer, especially if beans have been grown in the field recently. In fact, using inoculants on soybeans without an active on-farm testing program could be costing you money. But if a field hasn\u2019t produced soybeans in the past three to five years or has never produced soybeans, an inoculant is needed for nitrogen fixation to occur."}

However, this is a significant cut above your average chain restaurant.\nHaving been seated in a sleek, modern dining room, all polished wood and crisp white tablecloths, we opted for two set dinners, assured by the helpful Ma\u00eetre D\u2019 that the fixed price menu was made up of the restaurant\u2019s finest dishes.\nA selection of starters was dominated by a pair of eye-catching Dragon\u2019s Whisker Prawns, succulent king prawns encased in a cocoon of fine shredded pastry. Another highlight was a portion of Honey-Glazed Ribs, a sticky treat, the meat falling pleasingly away from the bone.\nNext up was that traditional takeaway staple, Aromatic Duck, served with the obligatory pancakes, hoisin sauce and spring onions. Done well, it\u2019s a thing of beauty, and happily, The Good Earth does it very well indeed, the duck beautifully tender, its skin crisp and tacky. Delicious.\nFinally, the mains. Chicken with Cashew nuts was another traditional dish done well, but Fillet of Beef in Claypot was the star performer, arriving still sizzling at the table, the flavour of the meat more than living up to the spectacle.\nAt just under \u00a340 per person, without wine, this Chinese banquet comes in a shade more expensive than your typical neighbourhood restaurant, but given the quality (and quantity) of the food on offer, it\u2019s well worth the extra outlay.\nIf you are looking for another reason to check out the area, visit The Ship pub in Wandsworth, which is ideal for summer drinks on the large terrace."}

The poll showed that in the swing state of Ohio, Trump would garner 15 percent of the African American vote against Clinton, with another 11 percent undecided.\nThat is huge increase from the 4 percent of the black vote Mitt Romney received in Ohio during the last presidential election.\nWell, well, well, even the ex-Obama-Czar-self-proclaimed communist understands and sees how Trump can win and be our next President! Wow! I\u2019m a bit impressed, but I wouldn\u2019t trust Van Jones with a lollipop either! Trump is pulling in some of the more modest democrats over to vote for him, and with the help of these two infamous Internet sensations, Diamond and Silk, created a place for them to do just that, called \u201cDitch and Switch\u201d, for anyone who either voted democrat all these horrible years and now sees the \u201clight\u201d in voting Trump, or whom never voted before and wants to sign up as soon as possible to exercise their constitutional right to vote, they can go to Diamond and Silk\u2019s website, and sign up. They can help direct you to the right place. Thanks, Van Jones, for your analysis of a Trump win, and he can do this, if every ethnic group would just open their eyes to see what the last 7 years have really done to them; not for the \u201cfreebies\u201d they get, for as long as they are listed poor, they can get the freebies, but is that what you really want? Just the freebies that this administration \u201cgives\u201d you? And where do you think that money comes from? Thin air? The upper clouds? Take heed, people, realize, that in history, in other parts of the world, where \u201cfreebies\u201d were a given because the people were poor and destitute, they were \u201ccontrolled\u201d by that government as long as they did the government\u2019s bidding, they got the freebies, so they just didn\u2019t work or even try looking. Then the government puts them to work, moves them to high rise buildings, stuffs other families with them in small apartments, and makes them go to work in plants, day in day out, but they get free housing, free food (which is rationed out periodically), and free stuff, but then it gets pulled because the government can\u2019t afford any more free stuff (phones, ipads, ect.). Take heed, this has happened, and it can happen again. Trump will get you back to a job you want and be proud of working because he\u2019ll limit the regulations of businesses who hire workers who want to work, and not hire out to foreigners either. You deserve a job, you\u2019ll get a job. Get off the freebie stuff because it\u2019s not going to last you a lifetime. Socialism only lasts long enough before the gov\u2019t runs out of money to sustain it.\nCommentary: Are polls underestimating Trump\u2019s support?"}

{"doc_id": "150", "text": "By Cecile Green and Rebecca Fisher-McGinty, republished and edited from Round Sky Solutions blog.\nEnlivening Edge Magazine has republished Part 2 of this article here.\nSo many of us have experienced bad meetings ranging from mildly frustrating to intolerable! In fact, bad meetings are so common, it\u2019s easy to assume they are an inevitable part of the status quo. If you have a small business, a nonprofit, board meetings, organizing meetings, a worker cooperative, or are interested in democratic or teal workplaces, you likely have to participate in meetings that drive you nuts for a variety of reasons. If so, you are in the right place, we wrote this post for you! In Part 1, we\u2019re going to focus on some of the things that come up during these meetings and then part 2, we\u2019ll share some solutions.\nPeople getting offended and defensive.\nPeople being accusatory and snide.\nPeople disengaging during the meetings and at all times.\nUpdates that go on forever and are not helpful.\nA few people that have too much responsibility.\nOnly a few people doing all the talking.\nWell intentioned people delivering inconsistent accountability.\nAgenda items that only reflect the needs of a few.\nAgenda items that take way too long and don\u2019t lead to meaningful outcomes that move things forward.\nMeetings with no clear ending that drag on for hours.\nSince bad meeting culture is so endemic it\u2019s easy to think that it\u2019s normal or unavoidable and I\u2019m here to tell you that while it may be normal, meaning that it happens all the time in all kinds of organizations, it\u2019s not healthy and it is entirely avoidable!\nSaps organizational energy and focus. There\u2019s nothing like an argument in the middle of a meeting for making everything worse.\nWastes time. Meetings are the most efficient way to sync up and align. When they are wasted with no clear decisions or next actions, people still have to obtain that information or risk doing bad or useless work. The work of obtaining that information outside of meetings represents a waste of time.\nSense of being stuck increases. It leaves people feeling powerless and frustrated leading to disengagement.\nUnderscores the sense of being overworked and underappreciated. When we don\u2019t have good mechanisms for redistributing work because we can\u2019t really see what other people are doing or not doing, it\u2019s easy for people to feel unseen and unappreciated for their work.\nMakes it harder to address important issues and get good work done. When meetings are wasted on conversations that go on way past any point of usefulness for the organization, the time we have to discuss and decide on important issues dwindles.\nGetting to facilitating effective, collaborative meetings can be challenging but is well worth the effort. Imagine what it might be like for you to have a organization full of inspiring leaders, with tools that enable you to hack your meetings into flows and effective outcomes? Well, for one thing, improving your meetings will save you time and energy and open up the space for everyone on the team to be more of their full selves, which simply feels better, and frankly gets better results.\nWith a generative meeting culture, here are a few things you can look forward to, including what some of our clients and students have shared about our work!\nEngaging and efficient collaboratively-led meetings. The power of joy and fulfillment that comes from productive efficient meetings goes on to infuse all of the work we do with that same motivating force, bringing much more meaning and productivity to everything that we do.\nWorking together productively with flow and satisfaction. Collaborating with others can be profoundly frustrating, and that frustration is a drain on both the organization and the individual. Getting to flow and satisfaction produces a host of benefits including longevity, in other words, people sticking around to contribute to an organization\u2019s success.\nNot getting stuck on issues. The feeling of being stuck in one\u2019s work with others is corrosive, especially if it\u2019s a consistent feature of meetings. Being able to move forward even on difficult issues is like opening the windows in a stale room and letting the light and air in.\nBetter innovation and problem solving. Working together is all about facing challenges and surmounting them with each other. Being equipped to do so efficiently, creatively, and innovatively is critical to organizational success in the complex and constantly changing business environments that we all find ourselves in today.\nMutual support & accountability. One of the biggest challenges of collaborative work environments where we are explicitly sharing power is accountability, both how we support each other in getting our work done, and how we hold each other accountable in the process.\nA real distribution of power and voice. This one is huge! If you really want to get innovating and feel some meaningful engagement from your team, try giving them real power.\nAnd the best part about learning all this is that you are going to be able to use these skills over and over again in all kinds of different contexts. It\u2019s like you\u2019ll have cracked the collaboration code and have super powers for enabling people to get along and do better work together.\nStay tuned for part 2 that will include 4 hacks and tangible tools to make your teal and democratically led meetings more effective and engaging.\nDo you resonate with the challenges of collaborative meetings? Who hasn\u2019t sat through a meeting that was poorly facilitated?? It can really put a damper on the work. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created this online training to support and train collaborative facilitators to really hone in on what\u2019s needed to get the work done in a collaborative and meaningfully inclusive way.

While it's been a huge event for our department stores for many years, online shopping has made grabbing a bargain much easier (with the added benefit of not having to battle people for the last gift box!).\nAdelaide has no Mecca Maxima stores, so I had to order the Urban Decay Gwen Stefani Eyeshadow Palette from Mecca online. While this has been available for a while in the US, it was only released on Boxing Day here.\nI'm IN LOVE with this palette. I feel like it was made for me. I know a lot of people have said there's not much in the way of colour selection, but for someone pale it's the perfect palette.\nIt retails for $95 here in Australia so it's pricier than the other palettes that UD sell, but you really see the amount of thought that went into both the palette and the packaging and shade names.\nThe packaging is gorgeous although it's quite heavy. I can't wait for the rest of the UD x Gwen collection to be released.\nLipstick Republic is an Australian online store that sells brands like Sigma, OCC, Lime Crime, Jeffrey Star, Morphe and more. They had 25% off so I put in an order for some products that were on my wishlist.\nI have previously ordered a Benjabelle Brush Tree from them and I wanted to buy another one. I already have the Mini Brush Tree, which holds 24 eye brushes but I wanted to get a large brush tree that also holds large brushes. I decided on the Sunflower Brush Tree as it holds both small and large brushes.\nI also ordered the spinner bottom as I don't have it on my other brush tree and I wanted to see if it was more helpful while washing my brushes.\nI've never been one for Sigma brushes (youTubers pushing their code down my throat makes me side eye the company) but I received a mini E25 Blending Brush in a Bellabox previously and I really loved it, so I ordered a fullsize one from their copper line. I also ordered the Sigma E45 Small Tapered Blending Brush as you can never have enough blending brushes. I thought that this would be great for me as I have small eyes and some blending brushes are bigger than my eyes!!\nAnd finally I ordered the Barely Cosmetics Definer Soft Sponge to apply my foundation. I like the shape of this. I haven't tried this yet. I can't wait to see how it compares to my beauty blender and RT sponge.\nI love Soda & Co's Instagram page of their natural body products and lipbalms. Their packaging is super cute and I love their pictures. When I saw that they had 30% off, I decided to finally make an order.\nBecause I haven't tried their products before, I decided to buy a pack that includes a body wash, body lotion and a sugar scrub that's in an adorable cosmetics bag.\nI struggled with which scent to choose from (pink lemonade, mint burst or orange splash) but finally decided on pink lemonade as I was worried that the others would smell like bathing in toothpaste or orange juice.\nI've been using them and the body lotion is the stand out for me. It feels thick when I put it onto my skin but it seems to melt and sink into my skin quickly. The sugar scrub is also amazing for leaving my skin smooth and soft. While I like the body lotion, it's a more subtle scent than the lotion and scrub.\nI hope that they eventually sell a vanilla or a lavender range as their 3 current scents are quite uplifting and I love using something relaxing at night.\nDid you purchase anything in the Boxing Day sales?\nAwesome Boxing Day haul! I didn't buy anything in the sales - trying to cut back!! I have the same brush tree and I love it!! I love my E25 minis but now I want to try the E45!\nThe brush tree is wonderful. It makes washing my brushes so much easier and less hectic.\nI haven't touched the sales since I'm waiting on Priceline's 40% off skincare sale sometime this month.\nI'm lusting after that same Benjabelle brush tree you bought! I own that same Sigma tapered blending brush (albeit with the silver ferrule & writing, not the copper) & if I'm honest, I don't like it. Whilst it feels soft at first, after you wash it it becomes scratchy...or at least that's what's happened to me. Not sure what I can do to get it soft again...maybe use some conditioner?\nThe brush tree is fantastic. I'd recommend it!! It makes cleaning your brushes a lot easier and less messy.\nOhh that's no good! What do you wash your brushes with?\nI can't remember what I washed that one with at first, but normally I use a mild shampoo (Moogoo's one) to wash my brushes. I might've used that, but I'm not sure why it made the brush scratchy, unless I was using the wrong product for the type of brush that it is (I think it's synthetic hairs?).\nBrush trees are so great, aren't they? I wouldn't mind trying that scrub."}

{"doc_id": "164", "text": "best year ever | The Jamestown Comet.\nResolving for a better new year.\nWell, the holidays are upon us once more and 2016 is nearing an end. It\u2019s safe to say that the past year has certainly been filled with remarkable change. What did 2016 mean to you? Was it an end or a beginning? Did you experience triumph or tragedy?\nIf you\u2019re like most, it was a mixture of both. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to discern the difference. What some see as catastrophe, others view as a success. It really depends on your perspective. Of course, the New Year is always a good time to make a change for the better in your own life.\nBut be aware that most statistics show that only around 46 percent of resolutions continue past six months. At the same time, people who set a goal based on a resolution are 10 percent more likely to succeed than those who do not.\nHowever you do it, in order to change your life for the better you have to get up and take the first step. And, sometimes attitude is everything where life changes are concerned.\nYou have to stay positive, dismiss the naysayers and keep motivated and moving forward. So, whether you start because of a resolution or just because you think now is a good time, your potential success or failure rests largely with your motivation.\nAdditionally, remember that you can\u2019t force someone else to change either. If they want a different life, they have to take the steps toward that end.\nFor example, suppose Lisa is dating Mike and she\u2019s having a tough time because he is addicted to role-playing games. Lisa wants to eventually marry Mike, but she cannot handle the gaming.\nLisa believes, however, that she can change him, help him to see the error of his ways. She believes that she can set a resolution to reform him with love \u2013 or a rolling pin (just kidding, she doesn\u2019t bake \u2013 she actually uses a frying pan).\nMike is never going to change because someone else wants him to do so. If he wants to quit playing he will have to do it for his own reasons. I am certainly no psychologist, but I do know that for any New Year\u2019s resolution to be successful, the desire to change has to come from within.\nI may be wrong, but I think the motivation for change at the start of a new year comes from a deep desire in all of us for a fresh start. Most people want to strive for something better, no matter what our situation. Of course, there are still people out there who simply don\u2019t care and are either complacent or resigned.\nFor some, the new year offers an opportunity to get \u201cit\u201d right \u2013 whatever your particular \u201cit\u201d happens to be at the time. In any case, it\u2019s up to you to make those choices and follow through. If you don\u2019t, you have no one to blame but yourself.\nYou can get things moving by creating a list of the things you want to accomplish in the coming year. For the record, I\u2019d leave out a lottery jackpot and focus on more realistic expectations, like finishing your education or pursuing a career change.\nThen figure out what it takes to reach those milestones and make a plan to get there (the \u201cmake a plan\u201d part is pretty important). You will likely have a great deal of work to do and, for some at least, a long-term goal may require multiple short-term steps. Be patient, work hard and stay focused.\nIncidentally, staying focused may indeed be the biggest challenge you face. The aforementioned plan is vital. Lay it out, be consistent, stick to it one step at a time, rather than trying to do everything all at once, and you can be successful.\nA New Year\u2019s resolution can be either a step towards improving your life or it can be a fruitless, frustrating endeavor that causes you stress and worry. It all depends on how committed you are to the kind of change you want in your life. However you do it, the choice rests with you.\nGery L. Deer is an independent columnist and business writer.

When vehicles were first introduced not all could afford it. Further it was not considered as a worthy investment. Only a few people used it. Over time the demand and usefulness of vehicles began to show. This caused a huge demand which resulted in the world we live today. The moment we step out of our houses we see roads. Vehicles have become so important that we use more than half of the land for roads. This by itself shows the importance we place on vehicles and the affect it has on our daily lives. All of us use vehicles to travel and it is a crucial requirement. This requirement has been increasing while the number of vehicles has increased. The increase has resulted in congestion of the road. Congestion is not the only reason for accidents, there are many. Here are the main reasons for vehicular accidents to occur.\nThe main reasons for accidents are when the driver gets distracted. This results in the driver ignoring the road and what is in front. Usually the main distractions are phone calls, text messages, smartphone usage, looking somewhere else and meddling with the radio. These accidents are dangerous as well. The driver may hit a bystander.\nSpeeding is a large cause for accidents. When the driver speeds he may lose control. This can be very dangerous in a highway where many cars can pile up when there\u2019s a single accidents. Speeding can cause an accident around a large area due to the force the vehicle impacts on. It can claim many live and may require powerful Nissan patrol wreckers to tow the vehicles away.\nDrunk driving is very dangerous and is a criminal offense. When a driver is drunk he or she is impaired and cannot drive properly. Even though it is an illegal activity it is very common. This is mostly due to young people. Drunk drivers can also speed and cause accidents. Drunk driving can result in every other accident such as reckless driving, running the lights, running stop signs are some of them. Police vehicles and various towing vehicles such as the Nissan 4\u00d74 wreckers Perth will be needed to clear the scene.\nReckless driving is another common cause of accidents. Reckless drivers are impatient drivers who may drive in an unlawful manner to get to their destination. These drivers not only endanger themselves but also everyone else on the road.\n\u00ab Why And When Do You Need To Take Your Vehicle To The Workshop?"}

The executive order frees Price to take aim at covered women\u2019s health services that providers, insurers, and employers may find objectionable under their religious beliefs. Price has an antiquated and paternalistic perspective that men should be in charge of the type of health care services a woman have access to.\nConscience Protections with Respect to Preventive-Care Mandate. The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall consider issuing amended regulations, consistent with applicable law, to address conscience-based objections to the preventive-care mandate promulgated under section 300gg-13(a)(4) of title 42, United States Code.\nReligious liberty is our country\u2019s first freedom. Americans of faith play a vital role in caring for our most vulnerable citizens, including the elderly and the poor.\nWe welcome today\u2019s executive order directing the Department of Health and Human Services to reexamine the previous administration\u2019s interpretation of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s preventive services mandate, and commend President Trump for taking a strong stand for religious liberty.\nWe will be taking action in short order to follow the President\u2019s instruction to safeguard the deeply held religious beliefs of Americans who provide health insurance to their employees.\nSecretary Price will not be happy until he has been able to strip away all coverage for women\u2019s health issues. The man seems to have stepped out of the 18th century when women had no control over their bodies. He certainly would have been in favor of eugenics and the 1927 Supreme Court decision in Buck v. Bell that upheld a state\u2019s right to permit compulsory sterilization of women deemed unfit to bear children.\nIn addition to taking the ax to the contraception mandate, Price expressed glee over the House of Representative\u2019s vote to repeal the ACA.\nThe status quo is failing the American people. Premiums are skyrocketing; choices are narrowing or vanishing; and patients do not have access to the care they need. Today, the House of Representatives has begun to deliver on President Trump\u2019s promise to repeal a broken law and replace it with solutions that put patients in charge. This is a victory for the American people.\nThe American Health Care Act is focused on patients. It is the first step toward a patient-centered healthcare system that will provide Americans access to quality, affordable healthcare coverage, empowering individuals and families to choose the coverage that best meets their needs, not what Washington forces them to buy, and equipping states to address the diverse needs of their most vulnerable populations. As Congress continues its work, the team at HHS will continue to support the reform effort by reviewing and initiating administrative actions to put patients, families and doctors in charge of medical decisions, bring down costs, and increase choices.\nThe American Health Care Act (AHCA) passed by the House allows states to file for waivers and allow health plans to exclude some or all of the essential health benefits under the current rulings. Price will almost certainly grant any waiver that strips women\u2019s health services from being offered in health plans. But his rational for allowing states to address \u201cthe diverse needs of their most vulnerable populations\u201d is fundamentally flawed. The Republicans have been promoting the idea that people in different states have different health care concerns. Therefore, states should be free to include or exclude certain services.\nThe health care needs of people are not dependent on what state you live in. A pregnant woman in Alabama requires the same pre-natal and other maternity health care services as a woman in California. The argument that somehow a person\u2019s health care needs change based on what state they live is tantamount to saying that people in Detroit should be fine with drinking lead-tainted water, but people in Texas shouldn\u2019t have to. All people should have access to clean drinking water because they are humans. All people should have access to the same health care services because they are humans regardless of what state they live in.\nThe other part of the AHCA is that it denies funding to Planned Parenthood. This means that women will have fewer providers to choose from if it passes the Senate and is signed by Trump. It has been Price\u2019s contention that the AHCA will expand access to care. But when the legislation removes hundreds of doctors who have been the primary care physician for thousands of women, how is that improving access to care?\nIt has become a tired phrase, but Price and his Republican-Christian-Conservative brethren put profits over people. Their ideas on the egalitarian nature of health care are that it should only be extended to healthy people who follow their holy scriptures. All others are unworthy of receiving affordable health insurance and decent health care. These people are just warped, stuck in their own little bubble world."}

The news wasn't some flashy announcement about virtual reality or about some new service for busy Manhattanites. It was something much more subtle and much more substantive.\nIt was the hire of Valerie Casey. Google \"Valerie Casey\" even today and only two listings make mention of her newfound connection with Walmart on the first page of the returned search results. This amount of attention is unjustifiably slight. Let this piece then serve as the hire's coming out party.\nShrewdly, Walmart has made Valerie Casey, formerly of Frog, Ideo, and Pentagram, its new head of design. She will be charged with leading Walmart into the future and ensuring that all its products and services, from websites to employee and consumer apps, will work in cohesion and from a singular experience design point of view.\n\"What's the big whup?\" you might ask.\nThe big whup is that this announcement clearly shows that Walmart has jumped feet first into the waters of next generation retailing. Under Doug McMillon's bold leadership, Walmart here again is taking one of the most essential steps to long-term success for any legacy bricks-and-mortar retailer\u2014specifically, redefining how it thinks of the word \"product.\"\nInstead of doing what many retailers do, like staffing de facto \"product\" heads within owned brand development, store operations, e-commerce, etc. and then leaving them to collaborate inside complex organizations with competing priorities, Walmart rightly understands that retailing has become so complex that all these aforementioned roles now need their own steward to ensure alignment.\nWalmart having a mission to help its customers save money and live better is one thing, but putting that promise into coherent action is another thing entirely. Many retailers take such coordinated action for granted, which is why so many legacy retail experiences feel disjointed across the digital and physical divide. Success rarely is found in the compromise and turf wars of internal politics. The buck needs to stop somewhere.\nPrior to e-commerce, before customers had the myriad of options they have today to consume products (via web portals, apps, social media, etc.), retailers were able to differentiate themselves by the products inside their four walls. The strategic practice of product differentiation became so prevalent and such a point of emphasis that it even gave way to the commonly heard parlance of retail being a \"merchant-led business.\"\nThe growth of e-commerce in the 1990s and 2000s rewrote the playbook though. During this period, Jeff Bezos built Amazon into the \"Everything Store.\" His idea was that as long as he could offer a great selection, convenience and great prices, consumers would gravitate towards Amazon over time. Boy, was he right, and, boy, did they ever gravitate towards Amazon.\nWhether customers try to order direct from Amazon or from one of Amazon's many third-party suppliers on its marketplace, it is becoming more and more difficult for a consumer not to find what he or she desires on Amazon. At this point, nearly 50% of all first product searches start on Amazon, indicating that Amazon is settling into the digital and product acquisition-equivalent of the 1980s shopping mall. The products inside a retailers four walls or within a retailers assortment are now, in a way, almost non-differentiating.\nBezos saw that the opportunity in retail was to put the customer first and to think not about the product he or she buys but about the Product he or she really buys\u2014for him, the Product (big \"P) of the Amazon brand. The white space in retail was no longer leading with product (small \"p\"), but leading with the discipline of Product Management, where his Product, or in this case, the Amazon brand, was the magic created at the intersection of great experience design, technology and business. Product was not a pair of khaki pants, a new set of bed sheets or a bar of soap. It was the culmination of a friction-free user experience that delivered on the universal truths of selection, convenience, and low prices and that exceeded consumers' expectations consistently, again and again.\nSadly, many retailers have not grasped this \"Product Problem.\" The greatest Product Manager in history, Jeff Bezos, saw the problem early on, while many merchant princes missed the signals and have even now admitted that they underestimated the impact technology would have on retail. Fortunately, Walmart's recent hire of Casey indicates that there could be light at the end of what has, until now, been a dark tunnel.\nWalmart is big. The acquisitions of Jet.com, Bonobos, ModCloth, etc. have only made it bigger and more complex, saying nothing too of the ever-changing demands of consumers and Walmart's ever-expanding interests abroad (see Flipkart). Therefore, it is only right that someone, like Casey, take up the mantle to oversee and to fight for the consumer and to ensure that all Walmart's activities look, feel, and convey the Walmart brand in the simplest, most straightforward way as possible.\nThe products inside Walmart's stores are immaterial to its future success. What matters is the Product of its brand\u2014its website, its store, its app-based services, etc. Those are the Products that matter. In a future world where the only thing that differentiates a physical from a digital experience is the memory and delight of being somewhere, a Walmart store is the Product or collective set of experiences that will get someone off his or her couch.\nA tube of toothpaste just won't cut it anymore.\nWhile the products within Walmart's store or on its website will come and go and ebb and flow, the shroud of the Walmart brand will be what matters. Walmart's store and its digital properties will be the envelopes that carry its brand promise.\nThe experiment that bears this out has already been run. We need look no further than the history of Amazon and also to the young upstart CEOs like Emily Weiss, Katrina Lake and Adam Goldenberg who are already thriving in this new world. Their collective early success indicates that they get the punchline to the joke of 21st century retail\u2014that the retail of the future won't be merchant led, it will be Product led.\nBest of luck, Valerie Casey. A bricks-and-mortar nation turns its lonely eyes to you."}

The suspected shooter was 37-year-old Melvin Rowland, a man McCluskey\u2019s family said she had recently stopped dating. Rowland\u2019s body was found a few hours later at a church; police said he died by suicide.\nAt a press conference, university police chief Dale Brophy said that McCluskey had filed a police report with them \u201con Oct. 12 and Oct. 13\u201d about threats from Rowland. There was \u201csome follow-up\u201d and it was assigned to a detective who was \u201cworking to build a case against our suspect at that time,\u201d Brophy said. The police chief would not go into further details about what happened with that investigation.\nOn Monday night, Brophy said that police got a call from a frantic mother saying \u201csomething happened to her daughter.\u201d In a statement released by the McCluskey family, McCluskey\u2019s mother said that she was on the phone with her daughter that night when she suddenly heard Lauren McCluskey yell \u201cno no no!\u201d Afraid her daughter was in a car accident, she stayed on the line while her husband called 911. A few minutes later, the family statement said, \u201ca young woman picked up the phone and said all of Lauren\u2019s things were on the ground.\u201d It was the last time she spoke with her daughter.\nPolice officers went to the parking lot and found McCluskey\u2019s body, Brophy said. The university issued an alert and an order for students to \u201csecure-in-place.\u201d It was lifted at 11:46 p.m., according to the university\u2019s website, after police determined that Rowland was no longer on campus. Brophy said that Rowland was picked up by a vehicle and, about 1:15 a.m. he was spotted by Salt Lake City police who ran after him. Rowland got inside the Trinity AME Church, where he killed himself. A retired pastor told the Salt Lake Tribune that, to the best of his knowledge, Rowland didn\u2019t attend the church and he had no idea why he chose that building.\nThe family of McCluskey, 21, said that their daughter had dated Rowland for about a month. She ended the relationship after she learned about his criminal history.\nLauren was a senior student athlete on the University of Utah track team. She was an outstanding student with a 3.75 GPA majoring in Communication and was excited to graduate in May 2019. She was a 2015 honors graduate of Pullman High School where she was Washington state champion in the high jump and the school record holder in the 100 meter hurdles. She attended Capital Church in Salt Lake City. She loved to sing and had strength and determination. She was dearly loved and will be greatly missed.\nPolice said the two had been in a \u201cprior relationship,\u201d but wouldn\u2019t comment further. According to Utah Department of Corrections, Rowland was convicted in 2004 of enticing a minor, a second-degree felony, and attempted forcible sexual abuse, a third-degree felony. His last known home, Brophy said, was a halfway house."}

What can make him walk more than a mile? It's not a party with paper hats or a case of candy that makes him fat, THAT\u2019S NOT WHAT HIPPOS DO! Nooooo. They, ooze through the gooze without any shoes, they wade through the water till' their lips turn blue, that\u2019s what hippos do!\nJust in case you were wondering what makes a hippo smile, right?\nBefore you jump to the conclusion that I have lost my mind, let me explain. For some, the introductory lines of this blog will ring familiar. They are the lyrics to one of many songs that will echo through acres of forests, hillsides, and riverbanks during the months of June, July and August. These songs will be sung by a passionate army of young children who, along with their mentors and idols, will be participating in a ritual cherished by the inner child in so many of us--SLEEPAWAY CAMP!\nIt\u2019s February, which means families across the country are securing their spots at one of over 8,400 U.S. sleepaway camps and over 5,600 certified day camps. Have you reserved your spot yet? If not, let me explain why I think you should.\nAs a parent of three and a former camper, camp counselor, and camp director, I cannot impress upon parents enough the meaningful impact summer camp can have on children. In my parent education classes, I often refer to sleepaway camp as the single most important and impactful experience a parent can provide their child. For most children, sleepaway camp develops the skills and mindsets parents so earnestly want to impart upon their children and does so in ways that we parents are sometimes unable to do. So why am I such a passionate advocate for sleepaway camp?\nIt\u2019s easy for a parent to forget that our number one responsibility is to prepare our children to LEAVE US. It\u2019s counterintuitive, really. We spend so much of our lives connecting with these little beings that grow up so quickly. We offer them all we have. In them, we place our hopes, dreams, and aspirations. Only to have them roll their eyes when we perse our lips for a kiss as they leave the car and say, \u201cGross, mom. My friends will see. Ugh!\u201d As our kids grow older they need us less. And they should. If you want to measure your success as a parent (and I don\u2019t necessarily recommend that you do), consider how well you are preparing your children to leave you.\nSleepaway camp is the single most important resource that I have found that helps prepare our children for healthy individuation. Individuation is a psychological term (coined by Carl Jung) that describes the process of self-actualization. In basic terms, a child\u2019s individuation begins when he/she starts to see him/herself as separate from the parent. As much as we might not feel comfortable with the idea of our child separating more from us, it is an essential part of the process of a child becoming a healthy adult. At sleepaway camp, our children are given the opportunity to see themselves through a lens separate from their parents. The very nature of spending several days and nights without parents in a safe and controlled environment allows children to expand their view of themselves in relationship to the world around them. Their identities away from us are allowed space to grow.\nOf all of the gifts sleepaway camp provides us parents, it\u2019s personal responsibility and independence that are often the most gratifying. After years as a camp counselor and director, the response I most often heard from parents after their children returned from camp was appreciation that their child was helping out more around the house. Parents would comment that they didn\u2019t have to ask their child to take their dishes to the sink, rinse them off, and put them in the dishwasher...it just happened! Parents were shocked to find their child had actually made their bed in the morning.\nAt most sleepaway camps (and if this is NOT the case for your child\u2019s camp, I would encourage you to find another one), personal responsibility is the cornerstone of daily life. Daily chore charts that require every camper to participate include jobs like: wait the tables in the dining hall, wash dishes, deliver mail, vacuum, collect and empty garbage, etc. At many camps, the kids are responsible for cleaning their own bathrooms. YES, even toilets. My favorite job to be assigned was \u201csuper spatula.\u201d This job entails scraping all of the food off of the plates at mealtime onto one main plate and then transferring the \u201cORT\u201d (or leftover food morsels) to the \u201cort bucket,\u201d the contents of which would be fed to the pigs at the camp\u2019s farm.\nOur children can be forgiven for thinking that the world they live in is universal. After all, many of our children haven\u2019t had the opportunity to see much of the world during their young years. Sleepaway camp, particularly those that attempt to attract children and staff from different cities, regions, and backgrounds, provide our children with new and unique experiences and the opportunity to navigate and negotiate social situations that involve people who are different from them and the friends they interact with every day. Often, many sleepaway camps will hire staff from one of several international staffing agencies, thus diversifying the experience even more. Camp program staff design clinics, courses, and experiences that are likely to be novel for the campers, thus expanding a camper\u2019s view on what he/she might enjoy or be good at. I have had the good fortune of observing scores of campers find new hobbies, interest, and passions from just one experience at camp. I know campers who have become chefs from having participated in outdoor cooking classes or children who have become veterinarians as a result of attending horse/ranch camp.\nWith peers: Ask any adult who has spent time as a camper or staff at a summer camp and they will most likely have close friends today that they met at camp, as well as an army of others that may not be as close, but whose sleepaway camp bond keeps them connected for a lifetime. Children learn not only how to build and maintain relationships with peers, but they also learn the VALUE of deep, supportive friendships. Especially as kids get older, I find that they appreciate having a world outside of school where friends \u201caccept them for who they are.\u201d At camp, children are able to let go of so much more of the pressures of \u201cfitting in\u201d and \u201cmeasuring up\u201d because they are in a new space. Not to mention, most sleepaway camps provide a technology-free environment for children to cultivate friendship the old-fashioned way--through conversation and shared experience--NOT through social media.\nWith non-parent adults: In an age when the pressures and distractions our children face are only increasing, one of the best defenses against childhood and teen depression, anxiety, and self-harm is a supportive adult outside the family that your child knows they can turn to. In school settings we ensure that each child has at least one adult on campus they know they can talk to, and a camp experience widens the net of available confidantes for our children. As our kids individuate, their bonds with other adults become more important. They will value and look up to role models they trust, and those trusted adults become part of the village that helps raise our children. As a \u201cretired\u201d counselor, I can\u2019t tell you how many now-grown campers still reach out to me for support, advice, or just a friendly and non-judgmental ear. It is a privilege for me to me held in that esteem, but also a helpful relationship for them as they navigate their way through young adulthood. I know the counselors whom I most respected held that role for me and my life is better for it.\nWith YOU: Before you worry that sending your child off to meet and bond with other adults will diminish your own relationship, fear not. Consider that a child whose parents trust them enough to 1) send them to camp and 2) encourage them to seek mentorship outside the parental relationship feels valued and supported, and will actually respect you more for that freedom. I find that as children grow up, the parents with whom they feel closest are the ones who have learned to loosen the strings appropriately. We want the best for our kids, and helping them grow a network of close adults who can provide advice and support is one of the greatest gifts we can give them. Believe me, they will not forget about you \u2013 they will love you for the experience!\nWhen I was a child, my friends and I were free to ride our bikes to the far ends of the earth (or at least that what it felt like) to discover our own adventures. We explored the outdoors with a lightness and whimsy that is often frowned upon today. Even though our neighborhoods are much safer than they have ever been, providing the freedom for children to explore the great outdoors feels too risky a venture for most parents. And even if we did provide that freedom, the draw of technology or the scheduling of numerous sports and activities has our children indoors and/or booked most of the time.\nSleepaway camp is a ticket outdoors without the worry of putting children\u2019s safety at risk.\nYou don\u2019t need me to remind you of the myriad of benefits being outdoors has on our health and wellbeing. There\u2019s plenty of great research out there to tell you that being outdoors can do wonders to your body, mind, and spirit. However, maybe we all need to be reminded that our children need it, too. Desperately. And if you are like me and live in the middle of massive suburbia with all of its pressure, stress, noise, and competing interests, then we share an even greater need to get out in the great outdoors. Sleepaway camp provides this necessary connection to the natural world for our children.\nBelow is a graphic published by the American Camp Association that highlights some of the benefits campers, parents, and staff experience from camp.\nI imagine that all this sleepaway camp talk has got you wondering a few things. Let me take a stab at answering the most likely questions you may have.\nI am also a big supporter of day camps. In fact my own children attend several day camps in our area and love them. There are so many great options with specific sports, music, art or hobby foci. There are also more globally focused camps that try to address the teaching of innovation, adventure, or making skills. Day camps are a gradual entre to sleepaway camp, too. All that said, there is some developmental growth and experience that only sleepaway camp can provide. In my book, including at least one week of sleepaway camp in the summer plans, along with a smattering of day camps and family time is a great recipe for summer growth and respite.\nHow do I know my child is ready for sleepaway camp?\nBegin with day camp experiences at least one year before signing up for sleepaway camp.\nIf possible, select a sleepaway camp that is near to your home when your child is younger. For those in the Bay Area, there are many options in the Santa Cruz Mountains and surrounding areas.\nA one-week session is usually the perfect starting point for a new sleepaway camper.\nStart talking about sleepaway camp early. My children hear about my sleepaway camp experiences all the time. Last summer we visited my former sleepaway camp in preparation for one of my children to begin this summer. He has been talking about starting ever since we visited.\nAttend a family camp at your favorite sleepaway facility. Most camps properties provide family camp options during the off season. These are great opportunities to acclimate your children to sleepaway camp.\nWhat are indicators of quality?\nI\u2019m going likely disappoint a lot of people by not recommending any specific camp. It\u2019s not my job to presuppose a family\u2019s needs and values; I also don\u2019t want to leave any quality program out of my recommendations. That said, there are some great resources out there to help you identify a great camp for your child.\nFirst get recommendations from people you trust. There is no better indicator of quality than the recommendation of friends, neighbors, and colleagues. Second, you want to make sure that the camp you choose is accredited. Accreditation ensures that camps have the proper facility maintenance, staff training and support, safety plans and measures, and philosophical approach. The American Camp Association is the largest accreditation organizations in the U.S., but there are others. To ensure that the camp is a right fit, you can also read online reviews and take a visit. Camps welcome parent visitors to their facilities to discover more; take them up on that welcome.\nSending your child to camp, especially the first time, with a friend is a great way to ease the anxiety that they--or more likely, you--have about being away from home for an extended period. Homesickness is real for many kids, even the most well adjusted and outgoing. Attending with a friend can help create just enough comfort, allowing kids, especially the younger ones, to adjust quickly to being away from home. Often, after the first experience with a friend, the childhood fears dissipate greatly. While attending with a friend is a great strategy, I do recommend providing at least occasional camp options that don\u2019t always include the same group of kids your children hang out with at school or in sports/scouts/church, etc. Having an experience that challenges children to get out of their comfort zones is valuable; attending sleepaway camp with a team and coach they are always with is great, but there is growth in providing experiences with children and staff with whom a camper is unfamiliar.\nWhat if I can\u2019t afford camp?\nMany camps offer financial aid and scholarships, as well as discounts. If you are interested in sending your child to sleepaway camp, but worry about the cost, contact the camp you\u2019re interested in attending and ask about financial assistance. Another strategy for managing costs is to get your child excited about sleepaway camp and use earning money toward camp as an incentive or a substitute for expensive gifts at birthday and holiday times. Having a birthday party? Instead of receiving a dozen toys as gifts that will get broken and lost within two weeks, ask folks to donate to your child\u2019s sleepaway camp fund. Many faith-based organizations and local community groups also sponsor summer camp experiences that are low or no cost. If you have the will to send your child to sleepaway camp, there are ways to make it happen.\nAll this talk about camp makes me nostalgic for my camp days. Nature hikes, horseback rides, all-camp capture the flag, campouts under the stars, the sounds of a dozen hammers pounding leather, S\u2019mores and camp songs by the campfire as fireflies light up the night sky. I\u2019m not sure what can make a hippopotamus smile, but I am sure there\u2019s nothing like belting the song out at the top of my lungs with new and lifelong friends.\nIf my words have piqued your interest, you might want to sign your child up soon. Spots often fill up in January and February for the summer at most of the best sleepaway camps. Give your camp a call today and feel free to let me know how it goes once the summer wraps up.\nWhat can make a hippopotamus smile? What can make him walk more than a mile? It\u2019s not a tune on the old violin, or listenin\u2019 to the whistlin\u2019 wind. THAT\u2019S NOT WHAT HIPPO'S DO! Noooo. They, ooze through the gooze with batting shoes, they wade through the water till' their lips turn blue, that's what hippos do! Yes, THAT\u2019S what hippos do!"}

{"doc_id": "190", "text": "This title is a comprehensive account of the key aspects of medical leadership. A highly accessible, text book-style resource, it explores how the medical profession has evolved in tandem with administrative and structural aspects of the NHS. Assuming leadership roles at all stages of their training and career is a progressively vital component of the definition of a good doctor. This book will provide invaluable support and guidance to anyone engaged in leadership within the NHS, but particularly to junior doctors in the primary and secondary care arenas taking on leadership roles for the first time.\nAn introduction to medical leadership and engagement: a perspective on this text. A historical perspective on medical leadership. Doctors and managers: differing perspectives. Roles and models of leadership. Medical leadership competency approaches. Why does it matter? Medical engagement and organisational performance. Medical leadership and primary care. Appraisal and revalidation. Practical examples of initiatives to enhance leadership capacity. Medical leadership and engagement: towards cultural acceptance and the future.\nPeter Spurgeon was Director of the Health Services Management Centre at the University of Birmingham prior to joining Warwick Medical School (WMS). At WMS he was originally based in the Institute of Clinical Leadership, which ran programmes in medical leadership for undergraduate and postgraduate doctors. The Institute also offered development programmes for newly qualified doctors and developed a Certificate and Masters programme in Medical Leadership.Peter was Project Director for five years on the Enhancing Engagement in Medical Leadership project, run jointly by the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement and the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges. This project produced the Medical Leadership Competency Framework (MLCF), now endorsed by the General Medical Council as part of undergraduate and postgraduate training. It also formed the basis of a modified Clinical Leadership Competency Framework for all clinical professionals and ultimately the Leadership Framework for all NHS staff groups.The project also produced the Medical Engagement Scale (MES), which provides a metric of the level of engagement of the medical workforce in the wider goals of the organisation. Peter has overseen the subsequent use of this measure to its current position of an international comparative database of some 7000 doctors. The sustained link between levels of medical engagement and organisational performance has seen increasing attention given to both assessment and development of enhanced engagement.Peter is now a Recognised Researcher in the Social Science and Systems in Health Unit of the Division of Health Sciences at WMS.\nJohn Clark is is an Honorary Associate Professor within the University of Warwick Medical School and was involved in the design and delivery of a new Masters in Medical Leadership. He is also an Adjunct Professor in Clinical Leadership, Curtin University, Western Australia and an Associate Editor of The International Journal of Clinical Leadership.

India and China are by far the two largest contributors, with 47% of all students for the 2015-2016 school year.\nThe visa application process can be confusing though, especially when English isn\u2019t your strong suit. We at TransparentCareer have laid out each type of visa used by international students, and the application process for each visa.\nF1 Visa\u2013 These are the most common type of visas, and are used for bachelor and graduate school degrees, as well as training programs in the English language. The first step is to check whether the university you\u2019re interested in is verified by the United States government \u2013 you can\u2019t get an F1 visa for non accredited universities. Take a look here to see if your school is verified. The first step is to apply to universities where you want to study. Upon acceptance, the university will provide you with a form I-20. Keep in mind \u2013 you can\u2019t transfer once you select a school. Make sure it\u2019s the right fit for you! You\u2019ll then have to go to the site of the US embassy closest to you, and pay a non refundable application fee. Find the embassy closest to you here.\nYou\u2019ll then have to prepare for an interview \u2013 the sooner you can set this up the better. The interviewer will require proof of intent to return to your country after you complete your education (such as family, home job offer) as well as a passport and the form I-20 provided by your school. The interview will also require proof of financial sufficiency to fund your education. If you need advice on how to finance your education, take a look at this guide. Depending on your school you may also have to provide test scores such as the SAT, GMAT, or GRE.\nJ1A Visa\u2013 J1A visas are for those looking to temporarily stay in the US for a work or culture exchange program, such as to be an au pair, international camp counselor, or for specific medical training. To be accepted, you have to be sponsored by a nonprofit or government organization. You can find a list of all approved organizations here. After applying and being approved by an organization, they\u2019ll provide you with a DS-2019 form to fill out. Then you have to apply for a J1A visa at your nearest US embassy. A Sevis I-901 fee must then be paid (sometimes by your sponsor), along with a Nonimmigrant Application Processing Fee of $160. You must then schedule an appointment with the embassy, giving plenty of time in case anything goes wrong. Bring along the DS-2019 form provided by your sponsor, as well as your passport, a 2\u00d72 photo, and any additional documentation that may be required depending on the nature of your program. You can find the types of documentation on the J1A government site.\nM1A Visa\u2013 This is visa for vocational training in the US. There must be a specific program/school when you apply for the visa, and you\u2019ll have certain requirements and forms you might have to fill out for the school before applying for a visa. You aren\u2019t allowed to work while studying in the US, so you must prove to the school that you have enough money to stay in the US while getting your training. If approved by the school, they\u2019ll give you a form I-20 to fill out, which you\u2019ll need next when you set up a meeting at your nearest US Embassy. You\u2019ll also have to pay an application fee, and bring your passport, a photo (with rules provided by your consulate), a DS-160 form, and a DS-157 form if you\u2019re a male between the ages of 16 and 45.\nH1B Visa- H1B work visas are for those that have completed a higher form of education and want to work in America \u2013 it\u2019s the most common way for foreign students to stay and work in the US after graduation. These visas have to be filed by your employer, so if you\u2019re hoping to stay in America after graduation you should start the job search as soon as possible. Approvals are done through a lottery system, and start to fill up quickly after the government\u2019s fiscal year starts \u2013 typically October 1. You may file up to 6 months in advance, so filing as close to April 1 as possible is ideal. There are a total of 85,000 visas issued this way each year, and the first 20,000 are reserved for those with master\u2019s degrees or higher levels of education. The remaining 65,000 are available to those with bachelor\u2019s degrees, along with those that didn\u2019t make it past the first round with a master\u2019s or higher level of education.\nA lot of controversy has stirred up around H1B visas recently after the election of Donald Trump, who has claimed on numerous occasions that he wants to get rid of people who got into the US unfairly. According to Forbes, the top 10 companies that sponsor H1B visas received 25,000 visas in 2014, which is nearly 30% of all issued H1B visas. Of these 10 firms, half were firms based in India, typically working with call centers. Trump and others supportive of a crackdown claim that firms are submitting multiple applications for one person in order to game the system. 236,000 applications were received last year for the 85,000 positions, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there were 236,000 applicants. While we haven\u2019t seen what a Trump presidency will look like yet, stopping people from abusing the system may provide more opportunities for foreign students looking to work in the US after graduation.\nCheck out our industry career guides on Finance, Consulting, and Tech to help you decide which is the best fit for you.\nLooking to stay in the states after graduation?

{"doc_id": "208", "text": "Dayton WordCamp | The Jamestown Comet.\nSome people are of the mind that there is a certain age when learning something new is neither a priority nor even a possibility. As I approach a half-century on this earth, I have a hard time wrapping my head around the idea that, at some point, people just stop learning.\nBarring some kind of dementia or other mental disorder, it\u2019s hard to understand why anyone would \u201cchoose\u201d to be an old dog, totally uninterested in learning a new trick. In my lines of work, I am frequently exposed to innovative technology and new ideas and I\u2019m expected to keep up or I don\u2019t pay the mortgage.\nI spend a considerable amount of time researching, learning new concepts or updating my skills in some way so I can stay relevant in a world that seems to change by the nanosecond. Part of that continuing education includes reading, networking with others and going to conferences and workshops. I just returned from one such conference that was, for me, one of the single best I have ever attended.\nA couple of months ago, I was asked by a friend to speak at an upcoming technology event known as, \u201cDayton WordCamp,\u201d a two-day series focused on the website content management system called \u201cWordPress.\u201d As with most tech, this event would be dominated by much younger, more advanced presenters.\nOriginally, I hesitated, feeling as if \u201cat my age\u201d (and technical level) I would have little to bring to the table. But, with a little effort I found a spot where I fit into the program nicely and agreed.\nDayton\u2019s event is one of hundreds of WordCamps around the world, all presented for the benefit of those using WordPress as their website platform. Lovingly referred to by organizers as an \u201cunconference,\u201d the atmosphere is very relaxed and laid back, with most people wearing jeans and T-shirts. One of the perks of speaking is the opportunity to attend the event as a spectator as well.\nOne of the first things I noticed upon arrival was that I was not the oldest person in the room. Of roughly 120 attendees the bell curve probably favored the younger crowd, but there were plenty of people my age and older as well. Such diversity says something for both the reputations of the scheduled presenters and the usability of the software about which we had all come to learn.\nAs the first day\u2019s session began my apprehension diminished and I began to settle into a comfortable atmosphere for learning. By the conclusion of day two, I was not only charged up to dive in and apply my newly-acquired information, but I wanted to find a way to be more involved in future sessions.\nAt this point, I have to give a shout out to my friend Dustin Hartzler and his fellow organizers, particularly Nathan Driver, who invited me to speak at the event while also allowing me to be a student as well (that\u2019s not the norm at such functions). These folks gave me the opportunity to expand my knowledge, allowing me to better serve my clients, plus I got to take a couple of days for myself, something for which I rarely have the opportunity.\nIn my experience, most people who have stopped learning have done so, in some manner, by choice. Learning is not just academic. Expanding your horizons at any age is not limited to taking college classes or immersing yourself in books for hours on end. You can attend free, hands-on workshops, watch \u201cdo it yourself\u201d shows on television, or just dive in and try something on your own, learning as you go.\nMy point is that there is simply no reason any of us should be stagnant. Opportunities for growth exist in many areas of our lives and all we need to do is take the first step. What is important is that you get out there and try, whether your interest is gardening, motorcycles, computers, music, or maybe you want to try something new. Don\u2019t be an old dog with no new tricks.\nGery L. Deer is an independent columnist and business writer. Deer In Headlines is distributed by GLD Enterprises Communications."}

{"doc_id": "210", "text": "HOW did they sneak this through?? I thought they said they wouldn't!!\nWe don't have emoticons angry enough to express how I feel.\nHardly anything in the news about it...this was the article that came up first when I did a search.\nIt was reported on our local news channel too, the suggestion was that the drilling site equipment would not be sited on any protected land, but the shale gas would be extracted by using pipes laid underground to get to it. I doubt the exploration drilling site will do anything to complement the beautiful countryside views, another eyesore to put up with. I have my reservations about this whole process, there has to be some risk ( even if it's very low) when you are injecting those sort of materials underground to release the gas, what happens to the sand, chemicals and water then? Does it permeate the rock changing it's chemical composition, seep into water courses or add pollution to the atmosphere? Quite scary and all for the sake of getting our own gas (if it can be recovered)for the future - at what price?\nI was sent a petition to sign in January, being run by Greenpeace but I don't remember seeing anything from 38 Degrees separately. Added just found this, I assume it's still relevant? speakout.38degrees.org.uk/campaigns/fracking-keep-your-promise Just signed it and it was accepted.\nFor me, the jury is still out with regards to fracking. I'm not totally against the proposals but 38 Degrees is a revelation - never heard of it before, I obviously lead a very sheltered life! So thank you for that.\nI agree with you, Shirl, about not having decided absolutely about the harm that might be done by fracking, but what does worry me is that it is yet more reliance on fossil fuels, when we are supposed to be committed to renewable energy. This is what makes me feel that big business is bound to be behind it. Thanks for alerting me to the petition \u2013 it's probable that I signed that one a while ago, but it needs to be said again. I have emailed them to say so. i also feel strongly that protected areas should stay protected.\nAlf, I am so glad you have been alerted to 38 Degrees (and do you know Avaaz, for the international equivalent?). It is a way of getting the voice of sensible, reasonable, concerned people (that's us, of course!) heard, as opposed to the government and business (much the same thing, at the present time) having it all its own way.\nI thought they said they wouldn't!!\nI have just read in New Scientist that senior environmentalists believe that fracking is the best option we have at the moment. Yes, it is a fossil fuel, but for reasons I don't pretend to understand, it is apparently far and away the best, until really effective solar power etc is produced. Here's an article in the Guardian about it www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/08/shale-gas-fracking-good-for-environment. But I'm still not at all sure that it should go on in national parks \u2013 they say that it produces quite an upheaval getting started. On the other hand, so do wind farms. No easy answers here.\nThe guardian article makes interesting reading and I have to say, the more I read, hear and think about this, the more accepting I am of fracking being a viable, and possibly the only, way forward given the demands of our society for energy. No body wants to see a drilling rig from their home any more than people wanted to see coal pits, slag heaps, gasometers, power stations, electricity pylons, etc in the past. There is a tremendous vitriolic outpouring around here whenever a farmer wants planning permission for a solitary wind turbine on his land so the opposition to fracking drilling rigs will be phenomenal! But, if we continue to demand the kind of lifestyles we enjoy now we need to learn to live with a few blots on the landscape especially if the blots provide the energy we crave along with a reduction in pollution and global warming. In the short term, fracking may be part of the answer.\nAny predictions about the long-term effects of fracking on the geology? of the surrounding areas can be nothing more than guesses.\nLooks like the regulator in this news item concluded that fracking operations did cause a magnitude 4.6 earthquake, but experts suggest that any fracking related future earthquakes are unlikely to cause any damage - are we confident in that statement or is it just that no damage has been seen to occur so far so that's evidence enough!\nThe latest thing I heard on the radio from a geology professor, who sounded a strong conservationist, was that damage had indeed been done by frackers in America but it was because they were cowboys after a quick buck and did things all wrong, and that sort of thing (earthquakes, contaminated water supplies etc.) was preventable if proper safeguards were in place. His opinion was that there is no way of getting energy that is without some drawback or other, but that fracking was a good candidate for being not as bad as most.\nDon't believe all you read about us, Yetis are NOT vegetarians: we love steak and chips.\nVery good and well made post Alf.\nI am an energy user, as is everyone here on this Forum. I want far better sourced energy and in time, I think that will happen. But I feel it will take decades or even centuries to get to a true 100% renewable/green sources. In the meantime I cannot see us going forward as a civilisation without at least very, very carefully testing the viability and environmental impact of such as fracking as a \"temporary\" source of energy.\nIf it passes such tests and can be done under National Parks with minimal and very strictly controlled pollution etc on the edges/just outside of the Parks, then so be it.\nAnd does that mean I would accept such as a drilling rig in the eye line looking up to the lovely North Downs, I live in sight of here in Kent? Not a National Park, but still very lovely, then the answer is a qualified Yes.\nDid anyone see the PBS America programme about fracking - it was shown a couple of times in the past week. Seems that there is little regulation for such activity in parts of US with result that well heads have been sited next to homes, schools and playgrounds - apparently allowed within 350ft (a study suggests it should be x7 that distance). There are 18,000 well heads in Colorado alone. Lots of companies have jumped on this bandwagon with no regard for the local population or environment. Earth tremors have been linked to inappropriate disposal of waste water underground and substandard lining of wells has allowed escape of gases into the environment.\nI'm still not totally against fracking but I sure hope it will be better controlled her than in the US."}

{"doc_id": "214", "text": "The Linux kernel now includes everything that is needed to use 3D acceleration with all GeForce graphics chips. Drivers have also been added for a Wireless Gigabit chip and a PCIe WLAN chip from Realtek.\nIn his email announcing the release of Linux 3.8-rc6, Linus Torvalds emphasised that he wanted the seventh release candidate to be the last one. When he released RC7 on Friday, however, he made no mention of whether there would be an eighth RC before the final version of Linux 3.8.\nAs long as no more major problems arise, though, the Linux kernel 3.8 should still be released this month. This article on driver updates will therefore bring the \"Coming in 3.8\" Kernel Log mini-series to a close. The first two parts of the series focused on the changes that kernel developers made to filesystems and storage and the platform and infrastructure code for Linux 3.8.\nIn Linux 3.8, the Nouveau kernel driver will include everything that the OpenGL driver \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is part of current versions of Mesa 3D and is also called Nouveau \u00e2\u0080\u0093 needs to use the 3D acceleration of all GeForce graphics chips available so far without further configuration. This is the first time that the Nouveau developers, who use reverse engineering to get the information they need to program their drivers, have managed this feat; before this, they were still lacking standard 3D support for some newer Fermi GPUs and the Kepler graphics chips, which have been on the market since March 2012 (1, 2, 3). For many computers, however, NVIDIA's proprietary graphics driver will still be a better choice, since Nouveau can't activate the faster operation modes for many of the newer GeForce chips, resulting in 3D performance that leaves something to be desired. There are also other issues, particularly when it comes to video acceleration and fan management support.\nVersion 3.8 of Linux is the first to include a simple kernel graphics driver for the graphics cores in NVIDIA's Tegra\u00c2 2 and 3 SoCs (system on a chip) (1, 2, 3 and others). The driver is not from NVIDIA; it was developed mostly by a developer from the German company Avionic Design. The company works on embedded solutions in close cooperation with NVIDIA and programmed the driver independently, but with input from NVIDIA. Surprisingly, NVIDIA jumped into the development process, publishing extensions a few weeks ago that let the driver make the graphics cores' acceleration features available, but these improvements did not make it into 3.8. Userland drivers are still needed to use the acceleration functions, and NVIDIA has yet to give any indication that it is interested in releasing those drivers under an open source licence. Nouveau developer Lucas Stach shared background information on the Linux drivers for NVIDIA's Tegra in a presentation at FOSDEM 2013, a recording of which is available on YouTube.\nThe Radeon driver now allows more of the graphics cores' DMA engines, which have previously been largely ignored, to be used from userspace (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The i915 graphics driver now supports by default the graphics cores of the Haswell processors that Intel will introduce under the name Core i4000 in a few months. The developers have also included a workaround for a bug in the Intel 830 and 845 chipsets so the graphics drivers are supposed to be stable on these chipsets.\nThe virtio_net network driver, which uses paravirtualisation and is especially used with KVM and Xen, should provide better performance now that it can use multiple queues for each network device. The same goes for the Tun/Tap driver, which is also used for system virtualisation as well as other purposes like emulating network hardware.\nThe batman-adv (Better Approach To Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking Advanced) mesh implementation developed as part of open-mesh.org to spontaneously create WLAN networks can now build a distributed ARP table, which allows non-mesh clients on a network to receive quick, reliable answers to their ARP queries.\nThe rtl8723ae driver for the Realtek RTL8723AE PCIe WLAN chip is new (1, 2 and others), as is the wil6210 driver for a Wilocity WLAN chip that operates at 60GHz and uses the IEEE 802.11ad standard promoted by the Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig).\nAnother addition to the kernel is the ar5523 driver, which was started over five years ago for the Atheros USB chipset of the same name. Extensions for supporting more chips and WLAN adapters were added to a number of other drivers; the brcmsmac WLAN driver, for example, now supports the BCM43224 Broadcom chip, while the rt2800usb RaLink driver supports the Sweex LW323 USB WLAN adapter.\nThe cdc-mbim driver, which supports broadband modems that implement Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM ) 1.0, specified by the USB Implementers Forum, is also new (1, 2). MBIM is a USB protocol for connecting modems for laptops, tablets and desktop computers that provide an internet connection using GSM and CDMA-based 3G and 4G (including LTE). Aleksander Morgado provides more details on the protocol and its advantages compared to other technologies in a blog post.\nThe kernel's audio drivers now support the Philips PSC724 Ultimate Edge sound card. The kernel can also handle VIA's VT1705CF HD audio codec now. The merge listing the most important changes to Linux 3.8's sound subsystem includes some other changes to audio drivers.\nThe kernel now includes a driver for human interface devices (HIDs) that use I2C (1, 2 and others), using the \"HID over I2C\" protocol designed by Microsoft and implemented in Windows\u00c2 8. Extensions were added to the HID multitouch driver to support some of the features for better finger and movement recognition found in Windows\u00c2 8.\nThe drivers for Video4Linux\u00c2 2 (V4L2) located in the media subsystem can now use the \"DMA Buffer Sharing Mechanism\" (dma_buf) integrated in Linux 3.3 to share buffer space with graphics cards, which makes it possible that data from video hardware will no longer need to be duplicated in the buffer in order for a graphics chip to display it.\nThe kernel developers have marked the uas driver, which handles the USB Attached SCSI protocol, as broken because it causes problems and is not yet ready for the major distributions.\nAlan Cox has given up kernel development for family reasons, leaving his position as maintainer of the serial driver subsystem. Cox is a Linux veteran who maintained the Linux kernel 2.2, during which time he was considered the second most important kernel developer after Linus Torvalds. Although he hasn't been that far up in the ranks these last few months, Cox has still contributed quite a lot to the development of Linux."}

The Bulldogs had gone 24-30 overall and 8-22 in conference play in 2015 to finish last in the Western Division and post the SEC's worst overall league record.\nBulldogs coach John Cohen, who played for Mississippi State's last SEC regular-season champions, said there isn't much of a gap separating the top of the conference from the bottom.\n\"If you're an inch off in the Southeastern Conference, you're going to get punched in the mouth a lot,\" Cohen said.\nSEC Tournament play begins Tuesday in Hoover, Alabama. No. 6 seed Vanderbilt (41-15, 18-12) faces No. 11 seed Missouri (26-29, 9-21), No. 7 seed Mississippi (40-16, 18-12) meets No. 10 seed Georgia (27-29, 11-19), No. 8 seed Kentucky (32-24, 15-15) battles No. 9 seed Alabama (31-24, 15-15) and No. 5 seed LSU (39-17, 19-11) tackles No. 12 seed Tennessee (29-27, 9-21) in single-elimination games.\nTuesday's winners advance to double-elimination play beginning Wednesday along with Mississippi State, No. 2 seed South Carolina (42-13, 20-9), No. 3 seed Texas A&M (41-13, 20-10) and No. 4 seed Florida (44-11, 19-10). The tournament returns to a single-elimination format Saturday and has a championship game Sunday.\nMississippi State made its dramatic rise up the standings by getting improvement from its new players and receiving a huge impact from its newcomers. Mississippi State's three top batting averages are owned by freshman Jake Mangum (.427) and junior-college transfers Nathaniel Lowe (.359) and Jack Kruger (.358). Kruger has a team-high .570 slugging percentage, Mangum leads the Bulldogs in on-base percentage (.479) and Lowe has a team-leading 47 RBIs.\n\"Those are all three new guys who have just had great first years,\" Cohen said. \"That's not common in the Southeastern Conference.\"\nCohen also led Kentucky to a regular-season title in 2006 and is the second coach to win an SEC regular-season championship at two different schools. Ron Polk led Mississippi State to four SEC regular-season championships before winning one at Georgia in 2001.\nHere are some things to watch in the SEC tournament.\nFIGHTING FOR POSITION: The top SEC teams already are assured of NCAA Tournament invitations but are trying to improve their positioning. Florida, Texas A&M, Mississippi State, South Carolina, Ole Miss, LSU and Vanderbilt all would like to be considered as regional hosts and/or national seeds.\nBUBBLE BATTLE: Alabama coach Mitch Gaspard and Kentucky's Gary Henderson acknowledge their teams are on the NCAA Tournament bubble after going .500 in conference play during the regular season. The two teams face each other Tuesday. \"You've got to win this game, you've got to get to the double-elimination part, you've probably got to beat (Mississippi State) on Wednesday and build those RPI points,\" Henderson said. Gaspard said that \"the winner of that game is going to have a whole lot more comfort after it and the loser is going to be sitting home on pins and needles for a week.\"\nDOMINANT GATORS/TIGERS: LSU has won five of the last eight SEC tournaments. Florida won last year's SEC Tournament and also earned the title in 2011.\nWHO'S SURGING: Mississippi State is on an 11-game winning streak. LSU had won 11 in a row \u2014 including two straight victories over Florida \u2014 before losing its regular-season finale to the Gators.\nWHO'S MISSING: Auburn (23-33, 8-22) and Arkansas (26-29, 7-23) had the SEC's two worst conference records and consequently didn't make the 12-team tournament field. With its losing record, Arkansas also is expected to miss the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2001."}
{"doc_id": "220", "text": "WBS: why is it important & why it is not important?\nCan somebody post their view or opinion based on practice, why is it that WBS is not important or why is it that WBS is important in managing project?\nI appreciate all ur input.\ncreating a wbs forces you to think about how you are going to dissect your project and organize your project into meaningful groups or packages of work.\nIt is a way to group your work so that people can understand the where's the what's and the how's you will approcah the work.\nfor example if you were looking for an activity in the 2rd floor of Building B and the activities were not group by building and floor it would be very hard to find.\nAlso by using a wbs you can collapse work and summarise work more easily.\nI love a good WBS!\nSee below link to one of our newsletters.\nI started using activity codes even before WBS functionality was available. And I still use them, precisely for purposes as you mentioned - eg filtering the plastering items etc. And since I started using these things from DOS days, I also make use of the characters in activity ID to represent various things. And as you correctly mentioned, it is also possible to get those functionalities from few characters in the activity description.\nIn fact, the best way to input your coded information is in the activity id. That way, the information is \"in built\" and cannot be changed easily.\nAll these things including searching and filtering (eg for filtering for certain characters in activity id or description) work well when everybody is disciplined in naming and coding. And as long as one person is doing all these things, everything works perfectly well for him (as it does for me and you). But when you are integrating programmes from various contractors, it is not easy to excecise those rules with planners from various firms.\nWBS concept is as old as project management but its functionality appeared relatively late. Even in P3 3.1, WBS is still optional function that appears the same way as acivity codes. And some people still don\u0092t use it because 1) it is optional 2) activity codes seem to do the same job and 3) they are more used to activity codes. But even in P3 3.0, WBS code can do things which activity codes can\u0092t.\nFor example, you can have WBS activity and it does not need any links as in hammock activities. And this WBS activity can summarise all the activities which have the same WBS code. When you need a high level programme that shows bars in the same line as activity description (activity code roll up bar appears one line below), you can just filter for WBS activities and you get very good presentation. And the list goes on.\nAnd when you start using P3e, WBS is no more optional and it appears more different than activity codes and thus makes it more apparent. But activity code has more functionality in new programmes as well as you can have second level of codes within same acitity code. And these lower levels of codes work exactly the same way as WBS does. So you can have work breakdown stucture as well as ANY breakdown structure using a single code.\nBut as long as you have to use two or more actity codes (as you have to do in P3 3.1 and earlier), to make your work breakdown structure, it is far more easier to do so using the in built WBS coding. (And you can of course, still use activity codes, for other functionalities).\nI can therefore sort as activity description contains plastering and all the activities drop out. Now If I have also coded for floors and towers I can organise so the towers and floors show up so I know where I am.\nThat means I need to code in a tower and a floor with each activity, thats pretty easy cos I can copy and past this info.\nIf I am really smart when I copy and past the fragnet I can add some alpha numerics at the end of the ID ie 100 activity number from fragnet then T1 (tower 1) then F1 ie the id is know 100T1F1 this helps in that I can sort all activities in tower 1 or floor 1 or whatever so by using the ID and the description almost without touching the codes we have a pretty robust sorting catergory. In turn when you can sort in this way logic application and resource balancing becomes much easier.\nLets go back to the plastering scenario we now have all the activities, so linking floor to floor or globally copying resources is easy as is levelling them because you can see whats happening and more importantly so can everybody else.\nIn this way you can tell your subby exactly what he needs.\nI am not saying you cant do it with WBS and of course you can what I am saying is for a great deal of what we do in building and Civil Engineering WBS codeing is excessively complicated.\nI\u0092m Currently using Hierarchical code structures to help with the application of the cost accounts from our cost tool. I simply apply the codes to the activities and then group and sort with totals and balance my activity budgets.\nSo you can use code fields to give rudimentry totals for Units.\nThis process has helped me immensley as when I started with this company 9 weeks ago there wern\u0092t even any baselines in the projects and they were using units % Complete and just adding extra hours to the remainings by multiples of 10 or 50. They even expected to be able to resource level with this data.\nActivity codes look good and seems to show what you want to show only when data is organized in a particular way (eg phase, location, contractor etc). So it is very much a Layout depedent method.\nWBS works no matter how you organize your activities. And you can have WBS activity (in P3 for example) which summarises all the activities which have the same WBS code no matter where those activites are located. There is no such functionality available for activity codes.\nFurthermore when you organize activities with acitity codes, you will always end up with groups with no names. Planner would understand it but there would be many would be questining it everytime they see it.\nSo when you want work breakdown that really add up to whole project, use WBS. It is that simple. And use activity codes for other organizing and filtering purpose.\nI suppose WBS & Codes are lying on the same concept, so why bother? you\u0092re not showing codes on your schedule anyway.\nDont let anybody walk away with the idea when you have explained something \"gee I wonder what he is smoking\"\nOften in fact more often than I care to remember I dont employ planners because they cant do their job but because they cant explain what their job is.\nRemember we are planners, that makes us somebody who assists the process not somebody who actually does it, so go and assist the person doing it by understanding what he wants not what you feel you should give him.\nThe WBS structure is simply an end to a means.\nThe end is being able to provide BAC, ACWP, ETC, EAC & EV for particular portions of the project.\nThe WBS is simply the most widley used method of doing this, and as a consequence comes as a standard part (or code) of most planning/scheduling software.\nAs far as codes go - well the world is your oyster.\nAs far as how to, and what size, and by what method you chose to quantify and divide your project up, it\u0092s really up to you..... However you should document what each structre is for and what assumptions were made to arrive at the particular structure.\nCBS - Cost Breakdown Structure, ETC.\nAgain I will say it\u0092s limitless to how many you can have, but you should document what it is and how you came up with it.\nThat way when you\u0092re asked to explain a code field that you thought was a good idea at the time - Your manager doesn\u0092t walk away with the \"I don\u0092t know what that guy was on about\" thought in their head.\nthis is very simple! you use WBS or Codes to make your Project become \"Measurable\" either in a summarized form or a detailed one. But how do you put a certain unit to a summarized deliverable? Isn\u0092t it Lump Sum (LS)? and how do you define Lump Sum? are you gonna need WBS or Codes?\nWhile the Explanation is well \"dry but clear\"\nI think all would benefit more if you provided sonme clarity with examples.\nAs I have mention before WBS development can be viewed as the process of grouping all project elements into several major categories, normally referred to as Level One; each one of these categories will itself contain several subcategories, normally referred to as Level Two. Alternately, and more accurately, developing a WBS involves dividing the deliverable items until the project has been divided into manageable, discrete, and identifiable items requiring simple tasks to complete that, when combined, constitute the project deliverable.\nLogically is to keep dividing the project until the elements cannot realistically be divided anymore and may vary from organization to organization or may even vary among project managers within the same organization.\nEach level of detail contains not only organization specific, but they also are specific to the nature of the deliverables involved in each project. Similarly, the degree of detail at the lowest level of each branch must be in line with the size of the project and in conformance with the organization\u2019s operational philosophies.\nIdeally, there should be some uniformity and consistency in the WBS. To achieve this uniformity, all children of the same parent must be developed based on the same division basis.\nUsual practice of WBS are using three division levels which are \u201cDeliverables oriented (Structure or products, functional system, physical area and proof of capability)\u201d, \u201cSchedule oriented (normally referring to a task or activity and sequential/ phases)\u201d and \u201cResource oriented (disciplines, administrative units and financial accounts)\u201d.\nSo again, no matters how you do it by codes or groups fields or using the WBS field as long as you define the structure into manageable level and represent the project deliverable that will contribute to success of the project.\nMost of my work is in building construction, so maybe the fact that I like codes better is biased by my work.\nBut if sometimes you need to see activities organized by floor; sometimes by trade; other time by trade within each floor, etc. There\u2019s no way to do that except with codes.\nDo other lines of work have the same need or is it enough for you to squeeze into a rigid WBS and limit reports and analisys to that single point of view?\nwhat I believe it says is that progranmmes should be structured in such a way as to enable sorting in a logical and affective manner thus enabling the team to ascertain an accurate picture of the progress of the works and the elements that make up the works.\n\"for hard planning thinkers\"?? they don\u0092t know how to use codes?\nWBS show the heirarchy of Scope of work and deliverables.\nWBS is the standard for PMI, PMP, Planning Professional.\nIt is very clear in PMI influence or way of project management in general and planning in particular way of managing project.\nSo for hard planning thinkers, WBS is the preference.\nI think the need and importance of structure in a schedule is clear and proven. The point now is how.\nI prefer primavera codes over WBS or outlines. Codes are much more flexible and let you organize activities in different ways to analize different aspects of a schedule. WBS an outlines are rigid.\nOf course you can use both at the same time, but unless I\u00b4m forced by a client, I don\u00b4t use a WBS, but codes.\nIt\u0092s just a simple divide and conquer technique. It a way to go from general to specifics. It\u0092s like writing a book first you have the outline the going to the details and contents.In a way it helps in organizing a project and simplify the job of a planner.\nBreakdown Structure - Work, Cost, Organization..whatever it is..It is important! I think nobody is using a one liner schedule!\nJust to explain more on WBS. As I have said on the other thread (Work Breakdown Structure is a results-oriented family tree that captures all the work of a project in an organized way. It is often portrayed graphically as a hierarchical tree; however, it can also be a tabular list of \"element\" categories and tasks or the indented task list that appears in your Gantt chart schedule). Meaning it can be shown on a different approach or style as long as it became meaningful and useful to other member of project management. It defines as a level of schedule to make it more sensible and manageable. It is used to define the project objectives with sufficient detail information into more detail groups of scope or task. Some planner/ scheduler used activity codes as their WBS and others are just the first 1, 2, 3 or 4 character of their activities.\nProper schedules are using this technique according to their own methods so they can level their schedule to more manageable levels.\nOn my own view \u201cschedule without the proper work breakdown structure is going nowhere or meaningless as its does not show the sensible picture of the project\u201d.\nAny serious program must have some kind of organization so it is usable for control.\nWBS is one way, but there\u0092s also activity codes.\nThe more detail that you want to see (monitor), the more important the WBS. A formal and logical structure helps capture the project data (activity type, resourcing, costing, progress etc.) in the most appropriate \"pigeon-hole\"."}

My editor has plugins that help me browse documentation and check my syntax, but none of that works without installing additional stuff, and Docker has made me quite averse to installing anything on my host system.\nSo, I started stringing together Docker commands to do what I wanted, and I grew frustrated at all the copy/paste, and thought: There\u2019s gotta be a better way.\nIf you\u2019re interested in how it does this, see the nitty gritty details.\nGo to the releases page.\nMake sure it\u2019s executable and in your path.\n--type go - select the default version (1.6) of the pre-configured Go image.\n--type python --version 2.7 - select the 2.7 version of the pre-configure Python image.\nCurrently, go, clojure, and python are baked in. More will come.\ncreate - Creates an environment.\nconnect - Connect to an environment.\ndestroy - Destroys an environment and its home directory.\nrebuild - Rebuilds an environment, preserving the environment\u2019s home directory.\nrun - Creates an environment and immediately connects to it.\nstart - Starts an environment.\nstop - Stops an environment.\ninspect - Shows details about an environment as a JSON dump.\nlist - Lists existing environments.\nimages - Lists base images or user specific images.\nEnsure that the skegio/python:3.5 image is pulled.\nEnsure that the skeg ssh key is present. If not, one is generated.\nBuild an image based on skegio/python:3.5 which includes a user matching the host user.\nStart a container running sshd that mounts ~/skegs/myapp in as the user\u2019s home directory and the current directory in as a subdirectory.\nDo I have to use one of the pre-configured images?\nNot at all. You can create your own image and use it by specifying the -i flag to skeg create or skeg run. For now, your image needs to be based on skegio/base (like nate/aws), but that will change as skeg gets more sophisticated.\nWhy does skeg run the container as a long running process and connect over SSH rather than only for the lifetime of a process?\nDevelopment environments live longer than a single process, and they often involve many processes. Juggling these processes within an SSH session is a well understood problem with great solutions (like tmux), so for familiarity skeg takes the same approach.\nAlso, there are many times where additional software needs to be installed and daemons run to try something out. A long running container is perfect for these situations. Skeg offers a rebuild command, which will destroy and create the docker container with the same environment home directory, making it easy to reset back to a known state."}

But more recently, ordinary citizens are taking part as radiation levels have fallen at the plant site.\nNineteen university students took a tour last November. The bus they rode took them past large tanks holding contaminated water as well as a massive piece of equipment attached to a reactor building to extract nuclear fuel. Throughout the visit, workers wearing protective clothing and face masks could be seen.\nThe tour was organized by a group called AFW, which stands for Appreciate Fukushima Workers. Led by Akihiro Yoshikawa, 35, a former employee of Tokyo Electric Power Co., operator of the stricken plant, the group began escorting tours by residents living along the Pacific coast of Fukushima Prefecture from 2015. A major objective of the tours is to show residents what decommissioning involves.\n\u201cIf ordinary citizens abandon interest, the plant site will be further shut off from the rest of the world,\u201d Yoshikawa said.\nHe said that 140 or so people had participated in the seven tours organized to date.\nIwaki resident Kaori Suganami, 39, took part in a tour last June.\nBecause of the core meltdowns at the No. 1 to No. 3 reactors, high levels of radiation continue to be emitted. This makes it very difficult to approach those three reactors.\nElsewhere, though, rubble that was strewn throughout the plant grounds due to the tsunami generated by the magnitude-9.0 Great East Japan Earthquake has been removed, and radiation levels in many areas have dropped significantly. Ground surfaces have been paved and trees felled, which has also helped lower radiation levels.\nAccording to TEPCO, about 900 people visited in the first year after the nuclear accident. Since then, the annual number of visitors has continued to increase. Local residents joining the tours also grew in number. About 3,700 people visited the plant in the first half of fiscal 2015. Of that number, about 250 were from Fukushima Prefecture.\nUnlike workers at the plant site, visitors are not required to wear heavy protective gear. The basic getup is cotton gloves, disposable face masks and special footwear. Visitors are required to carry dosimeters. To reduce radiation exposure, visitors remain on the bus for large parts of the tour. Radiation exposure after an hour is in the range of 10 microsieverts, which is about 1 percent of the maximum additional radiation exposure of 1 millisievert established for the general population.\nIn April 2014, TEPCO established a visitation center at the Fukushima plant and two to three groups consisting of individuals 18 or older are allowed in daily. But not just anyone is allowed on the tours. \u201cAn overall assessment is made after considering such factors as the objective of the visit,\u201d said a TEPCO official.\nThe decommissioning work is expected to take decades.\n\u201d FUKUSHIMA\u2013Fukushima Prefecture\u2019s population has declined by 5.7 percent since 2010, its largest recorded drop and the cause of a widening gender gap in some areas, according to national census figures announced on Dec. 25.\nThe population drop is mainly due to ongoing evacuations following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, according to the preliminary figures released by the prefectural government.\nThe prefecture lost 39,715 men and 75,743 women, a decrease of 4 percent and 7.3 percent from 2010, respectively. The difference is thought to have been caused partly by the majority male presence in reconstruction efforts.\nThe national census figures are the first released by the prefectural government since the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, which triggered the nuclear disaster at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant.\nFukushima prefecture\u2019s population as of Oct. 1 stood at 1,913,606, down 115,458, or 5.7 percent, from the last census in 2010.\nAmong the six towns and villages where the entire population has left under evacuation orders, four towns recorded zero inhabitants: Okuma and Futaba, which co-host the nuclear plant, and nearby Tomioka and Namie.\nThe village of Katsurao had 18 people who have returned to their homes after being evacuated. They are recorded as temporary residents, but the central government is working to make their resettlement permanent. Katsurao\u2019s evacuation order is scheduled to be lifted next spring.\nNaraha, where an evacuation order was lifted on Sept. 5, also experienced a massive decrease in its population, with 976 people living in the area, down 6,724 people, or 87.3 percent, from 2010. The figures illustrate the fact that few evacuees have opted to return home.\nThe town of Hirono, where a large portion of the population is involved in nuclear reactor decommissioning work, tallied a male population of 2,746, up 2.3 percent from 2010. The female population, on the other hand, was about half that figure at 1,577, down 42.3 percent.\nThe population figures are based on the number of people living in the prefecture as of Oct. 1, irrespective of whether they are registered as local citizens.\n\u201d Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility that runs the destroyed Fukushima nuclear plant, has opened a rest area and canteen for cleanup workers, more than four years after the world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.\nTokyo Electric has been widely criticized for its treatment of workers and handling of the cleanup, which is expected to take decades. A Reuters investigation in 2013 found widespread labor abuses, including workers who said their pay was skimmed and spoke of scant scrutiny of working conditions at the plant.\n\u201cWe have taken various steps to cut accidents, including Tokyo Electric itself working more with contractors on the ground,\u201d Akira Ono, Fukushima plant manager, told Reuters."}

{"doc_id": "242", "text": "Science experiment: Try taking a deep breath through an average soda straw. Not too easy is it? This is basically what your SS has to accomplish with it's stock intake system. Now take a deep breath without that straw in your mouth (for those of you that live in a smog-choked area like Los Angeles or New York City, the State of California wants you to know that this action might be harmful to your health). If you live in a clean area of your state or country, you should feel heartily refreshed afterwards. This is how your SS will feel after you chop the stock intake system and add a new system to help it breath easier.\nThere are many alternatives to get more outside air into your motor, as it is optimal to duct in cooler, more oxygen-rich fresh air, rather than drawing hot oxygen-poor air from the engine compartment with an open-element air cleaner. One in particular that will use a minimum of duct work to direct airflow, is to install a cowl induction or ram-air hood so the engine can draw air directly from the outside of the engine compartment. An added benefit of an induction hood (be it \"ram-air\" style, cowl induction style, or via a hood scoop) is that as you drive faster, more air is pressurized in the intake tract, thereby \"force feeding\" your motor an additional charge of air, proportional to the amount of air the engine needs. Plus an induction hood just has that timeless hotrod appeal that oozes with coolness.\nFor this buildup, I chose a cowl induction hood, to give my 454SS a look that dates back to it's muscle car heritage in the SS Camaros, Chevelles, and the like, and to keep it smooth and clean. Some other hotrodders might prefer a later-model Camaro-style ram-air hood. Others might find they need a hood scoop to clear some air cleaner assemblies. It is nothing more than the preference of the buyer.\nOne consideration that is not simply preference is hood material. Realistic, affordable hoods are made out of two materials: steel or fiberglass. Steel hoods are typically more rigid and heavier than glass hoods, and most are a direct bolt-on for the stock hood. Steel hoods also do not require retaining pins on the front of the hood in most instances. There is some variance of quality but most steel hoods are of good to excellent quality, and your body man is probably better suited to work with steel than glass. On the other hand, fiberglass does not rust. Fiberglass does not dent. You can pick up a fiberglass hood (even a superb quality hood). By yourself. A good quality bolt-on glass hood also does not need hood pins to keep it retained. A great quality glass hood costs about the same or less than a steel hood, and due to the lighter weight, costs less to ship. Glass is my choice. Our options- and metal-laden 4800 pound (most of which is in the front) 454SS's need all the weight reduction they can get. Choose your material. Goodmark makes some of the best steel cowl hoods at glass-competitive prices which feature a 2\" rise, cowl screen, and boasts an extremely OEM-like fit. They can be reached at 770-339-8557, website www.goodmarkindustries.com. Harwood is THE name in auto fiberglass and Lexan, and they can be reached at 1-800-882-7223, website http://www.martelbros.com/harwood/harwood.\nNow with your hood selected and delivered, it is time to fit it on your vehicle. Steel hoods, if you bought a good quality one, should fit right onto the stock hinges, and only require adjustment and possibly some shimming to get the hood in the proper location before you prime and paint. Steel will typically come with a protective black paint coat to prevent rust during shipping. Goodmark notes that their protective coat is meant to be sprayed over, like POR-15 rust preventer is.\nFiberglass requires more prep work. Unlike steel, fiberglass hoods are not stamped out, and thus, must be trimmed, sanded and otherwise fit to the specific vehicle it is being installed on. First, you must remove the stock hood and hinge springs. If it is a bolt-on hood, operating like the one you are removing from the truck, you will be using all of the hardware from the stock hood on the new hood (a sidenote: unless you are building an all-out race truck, you will probably want the bolt-on hood rather than the lift-off or pin-on style hood that requires removal of the hood every time you want to access the engine bay). Now, lay on the new hood and check for fit. The edges of the hood will need to be trimmed. This may be done with a block sander and coarse sanding paper (80 to 120 grit). Sand off a little, then check again, sand a little more and check, etc. until you have the proper fit and finish. Our trucks have a cowl vent between the hood and windshield. Harwood recommends trimming the back edge of the hood to fit this cowl vent as the stock hood did. Once the hood fits perfect, you are now ready to bolt it on the hinges. Bolt it to the hinges, and the hinges to the truck, and check again for clearance.\nIncluded with earlier style Harwood hoods and some other lesser-known brands of hoods is a prop rod. This is intended to hold the hood up, basically taking the place of the hinge springs, as the springs will not be re-used (for steel hoods and for some glass hoods, like the revised Harwood hoods, they are, but most other glass hoods will not withstand this usage). Install the prop rod on the radiator support rail. Harwood said this prop rod is a universal fit, so it is necessary to trim it to fit. Position it in the middle of the hood so as to prevent the hood from twisting while it is on the prop rod. If you position the prop rod to the side, you run the risk of twisting and cracking the hood or paint job.\nFor the later, revised Harwood hoods the company notes that prop rods are not necessary. I spoke with Ray Martel, president of Martel Brothers Performance who owns Harwood, and he said that the bolt-on hoods for many applications have been redesigned and strengthened, allowing one to use the stock hinge springs. If you do not receive a prop rod with your hood, it does not need one, he says.\nNow you are ready to install the hood latch and spring on the front of the hood. Position the hood and adjust it in using the bump stops and adjustment screws. Check again for fit and operation.\nAfter you drive around for a week (or if you are like me, let it sit in the sun for about a week and a half) with an unfinished hood sitting atop your otherwise pristine SS, to allow the gelcoat to stabilize and the fiberglass agents to bond and cure, your truck is now ready to be shipped off to your body shop for finishing, priming, and painting."}

During this period some state Medicaid programs transferred costs for home care claims to the Medicare program to reduce their liability and increase beneficiary access to Medicare coverage. This article reports the findings of the first national study of these Medicare maximization billing practices for home care services. Primary data were collected to determine which states conduct retrospective Medicare billing practices and the amounts recovered from Medicare. Our analysis indicates that seven states recovered as much as $265 million from Medicare in state and federal dollars during the 1990s. Ratios of recovered expenditures-to-costs incurred for retrospective billing practices conducted in Connecticut, New York, and Massachusetts are between 5:1 and 7:1. While retrospective billing practices may aid states in reducing Medicaid outlays and potentially help dual Medicare beneficiaries gain coverage for their home care claims, they increase Medicare expenditures for home care at a time of concern for the long-term financial viability of Medicare and illustrate the need for reforming our national long-term care financing policy."}
{"doc_id": "244", "text": "Sign up to Lineout to stay up to date with all of the latest RUPA news / Thanks for subscribing!\nWith Rugby World Cup (\u201cRWC\u201d) underway the eyes of the world are on our sport. One of the most topical debates across all contact sports is the issue of concussion management.\nAll stakeholders will be looking forward to a RWC in which players, medical personnel and team support staff play their part in managing this important aspect of player welfare. Rugby is making significant progress in the detection and management of concussion and it will be important that other professional rugby competitions move to adopt the standards set for RWC 2015. Rugby should not see the management of concussion as a risk at RWC, but an opportunity to demonstrate how far the game has come in recent times.\nThe International Rugby Players Association (\u201cIRPA\u201d) is constantly thinking about what more can be done to further improve the games ability to manage the issues associated with concussion.\nEffective from 1st August 2015 after a successful global trial period at elite level, World Rugby has now formally introduced a temporary substitution rule. This applies to any player who is removed from the field of play to undertake a Head Injury Assessment (HIA) when it is unclear if that player has a suspected concussion.\nHaving the ability to remove a player from the action and from the cauldron of a packed stadium, to undertake a thorough clinical assessment and video review of an incident, in a private controlled environment, makes good practical sense. Previously players in this situation would often go untreated, or be checked over briefly on field using questionable methods.\nWorld Rugby and other key stakeholders are leading a real culture shift amongst professional players, coaches and medical personnel in relation to peer pressure to play. Recent statistics back this up. Research has underpinned the HIA process throughout. Prior to the temporary substitution trial, 56 per cent of players with a confirmed concussion remained on the field following their injury. Now that figure is less than 12 per cent (British Journal of Sports Medicine, 2014) and the hope is that following continued refinement of the HIA process we will see further improvement in 2015 and beyond.\nA key point lost on many but one that IRPA believes is fundamental to a conservative management approach is that a player is now removed once the attending medics confirm a diagnosis of suspected concussion. This takes the pressure off trying to make a definitive diagnosis of concussion during a high-pressured game. That does mean players will be removed who have not suffered a concussion, but better the conservative approach.\nThankfully the message is getting through and along with World Rugby\u2019s #RecogniseAndRemove campaign, the games stakeholders are realising that it is not just the player\u2019s responsibility but its coaches, referees, and team support staffs obligation to step in if they suspect a concussion has occurred.\nWhilst IRPA see this as a positive step, it is one that needs to be continually developed and filtered down to the community game where awareness and education on the subject is not yet at the same level.\nMedical specialist in concussion monitoring individual cases.\nAdditionally, IRPA is very supportive and engaged on the work that is being undertaken on the laws of the game to ensure the risks of on-field instances that result in serious injury, including concussive events, are minimised.\nThere is much conjecture on if rugby, and concussions sustained playing the game, lead to long-term cognitive health issues. From a player\u2019s perspective IRPA does not want that debate to be a distraction from making sure the right thing is done by the players now. IRPA believes that the game should be doing all it can to ensure the welfare and health of the player is an ongoing priority.\nSo what of the future and in particular the debate of using new technologies to take human error out of the equation? One such advancement that may justify further research and refinement is the use of sensors to help aide team doctors with real-time data. It could provide insight into accelerations and forces that they may not have seen first-hand particularly where the player has either not recognised a head knock, chosen not to seek medical assistance or suffered signs and symptoms post game. The sensor does not diagnose a concussion but rather provides accurate previously unavailable live information which combined with testing (HIA) and baseline data can aid in a clinical diagnosis. In the same way team support staff use other data like heart rates and GPS data, the sensor can provide data to assist medical personnel make informed decisions regarding concussion management.\nFrom a player welfare perspective, IRPA believes the pressure put on players to return to play to preserve their contracts and the rehabilitative support provided to players recovering from a concussion are areas that should be looked at further.\nEnsuring a players contractual terms and conditions are supportive during times of serious injury is fundamental. It allows the player the opportunity to fully recover without the added pressure or threat of having his or her salary or match payments stopped, or worse, the contract terminated. In this respect physical injuries are more obvious and certain, concussion in its very nature is obscure and invisible. Currently there are no set guidelines around minimum standards for players\u2019 contractual terms and conditions. IRPA feels that the time is right to address this, not just because of the issues around concussion, but to maintain the integrity and reputation of the game.\nFor those players who endure concussion complications either as part of their return to play process, or following a decision to stop playing, there seems little available to aide recovery beyond rest and time \u2013 which for an active professional athlete can be a very uncertain and sometimes depressing experience. IRPA would support more research into identifying rehabilitation techniques and programs to help in the resilience building and recovery process, and to ensure they are readily understood and available throughout the game.\nWorld leading player welfare standards are a priority in building the legacy of our sport. It is fundamental to the integrity of the game and to those who participate in it. IRPA is looking forward to continuing to work with World Rugby to bring about the culture change and to enhance the education and regulatory framework that ensures rugby leads the way on concussion management globally.\nThe Rugby Union Players' Association (RUPA) will continue to take a proactive and collaborative approach to concussion prevention and management in Australia sport, as part of its involvement with the Australian Athletes' Alliance (AAA).\nEvery week, RUPA collates five of the best features from the week\u2019s Rugby media and bring them to you in the one convenient location.\nCharlie Fetoai: Jack of all trades; master of plenty!\nFormer Reds centre Charlie Fetoai was seriously injured in 2009 and told he could never play Rugby again. He spoke to RUPA about what he's been up to since, and the importance of planning for life after Rugby."}

{"doc_id": "249", "text": "Anyone who has done a quick search on what to see in Norway certainly came across Preikestolen. It is one of the most popular hikes in the whole country. Not everyone experiences it the same way, however. Outdoor Life Norway is a guided service that offers guests a chance to see Pulpit Rock like most will never experience. The sunrise hike is an amazing way to up your chances of getting those stunning views without the crowds. If you truly want an original experience, though, go with their \"Off the beaten track\" tour. This hike begins with canoeing across a glacial lake to a long forgotten trail. Traverse the trail through multiple altitudinal zones and scramble up to the top of the fjord. There you can hike along until you reach your destination, a beautiful view of Preikestolen! There you can enjoy your view that majority of the hikers are missing. From there you will travel down to Pulpit Rock itself for some more photos. The trip down follows the more popular marked trail. If you are lucky enough, you may run into some of the Sherpas that have built the trails! If you're looking for more tours to fill up time in Norway, Outdoor Life Norway offers many guided services year round.\nThe land of fire and ice is an outdoor enthusiasts playground. Scuba diving in Silfra had been on my bucket list for years. It was a massive influence for me to get my PADI Open Water certification. Once I got my certification I remember my instructor asking me where I would go now that I could explore underwater paradises. I excitedly announced I'd be going to Iceland. He did not seem amused. \"Don't you want to start somewhere... warmer?\" I brushed off his remark as quickly as I whisked off my hood and booties. I had my mind made up. Silfra was my white whale and I finally had it in my headlights. When everything was booked, I was struck with panic. For years I had dreamed of Silfra, a place where you could swim between the North American and Eurasian continental plates. Would it be as spectacular as I had made it out to be?? Oh yes it was. The crystal clear glacial water is nearly ice cold and is filtered through lava creating over 300ft of visability. This quality of water means you can sip it while you're diving. It doesn't get fresher than that. Being able to say i've touched both continental plates at the same time in the only place in the world where you can dive directly in continental plate cracks is certainly bragging rights. I thought that would be the highlight of my cold swim in Silfra, but once I was in the water I forgot about the location. The dive was beyone beautiful with such distinct geographical features. The colors were jaw dropping. Though the dive itself was short, it's a dive that I could do over and over again. For those not scuba certified, many tour companies offer snorkeling excursions as well. Dive. Is. offers guests either option with photo services.\nIf you asked a stranger what came to mind when they thought of Iceland, volcanoes would make the list. This is definitely merited. The land has practically been completely molded by volcanic eruptions. If there's volcanoes you know there is lava, but Icelanders don't let it get them down. In fact, it gets them going. These hardened lava fields create the perfect backdrop for some serious mountain biking. These trails are not for the faint of heart. I may have overestimated my skills since I had been mountain biking in the past. I rated myself as an intermediate, which I quickly second guessed as soon as I saw people pull out their own peddles from perfectly packed Camelbaks. As nonchalantly as I could muster, I asked what the tour company's general client level was. My growing suspicion was confirmed. Most were season mountain bikers. I laughed in response to hide my surmounting fear. There was a good chance I may die in Iceland on a bicycle, I thought. There was worse ways to go I reasoned. It would make an interesting story, at least. Alas, I survived. Every part of my body may have hurt the next day, but something else was genuine as well. That was my smile. I signed up for a tour that I was not physically prepared for, but I did not regret it. It was a challenge that I overcame and I saw some stunning scenery along the way.\nFor those of you like me who are not expert mountain bikers, there are more appropriate tours to take. Icebike offers guests several options for different levels of experience. After seeing my lack of finesse in the lava fields, Icebike offered to take me to another location afterwards. I battled with my opposing feelings. Should I stick it out and do another lava field or should I opt for something different? The guide was very patient and genuinely wanted me to enjoy the experience that was right for me. I went with their recommendation. A part of me felt like a quitter until I saw the change of scenery. The lava fields were wild and otherworldly. The new scenery was as lush as if I had been plopped into Neverland itself. My bitter feelings instantly faded. Biking through the purple lupine fields was a magical end to a demanding day. My lesson of the day: Don't be afraid to try new things and have flexibility if they do not work out as perfectly as planned. My biking experience had more hiccups than I had predicted, but biking in Iceland was a once in a lifetime experience.\nUtah snow is world famous. In a location with pristine snow and more resorts than one can choose from, how does one... well, choose?? I struggled with the dilemma during a recent visit. I was down to my last day and I had only seen two resorts. I wanted to end with a bang without draining my bank account on a lift ticket. I gave up and resorted to asking my local friend for direction. \"You need to go to Sundance\". Sundance? I was baffled. This resort had barely made my radar. While I had pondered the pyramid hierarchy of ski resort awesomeness for days, it took my friend no time at all to respond to me.\"Not Snowbird or Park City?\" I bantered. Nope, he was firm. Well that settled my predicament. At the very least it would bring me some mental clarity since I no longer had to wrestle the decision.\nIf you go to Utah and don't visit Sundance Resort, you are doing it wrong. I immediately felt at home at this resort, as if I had been snowboarding there since I learned the difference between regular and goofy. In a world obsessed with modernizing everything, Sundance has made a point of preserving that nostalgic ski culture that we all love and miss. Okay, so the staff is nice. Is that a good enough reason to opt for Sundance over a larger resort? In retrospect, Sundance is one of the smaller resorts, but the views are not. I almost fell off the chairlift gawking at the scenery. From the base to the peak, every corner of the resort offered views that even Ansel Adams would have to stop and photograph. The character didn't stop at the lodge. The terrain kept me smiling from trail to trail. Feeling hungry? Stop at the peak for the most scenic nachos in the game. The Bearclaw Cabin is the only mountaintop lodge in Utah. If the sun is out, opt to sit outside in one of the zero gravity chairs. Sun and snow, can you beat it? If you want a resort with big hearts, big views, and a touch of home, you need to go to Sundance Resort.\nThe sunshine state usually cultivates images of lazy beach towns with a weird abundance of shaggy-haired surfers with names like \"Zander\" or \"Brock\". If you don't think of surfing, chances are you think of a retirement home paradise with every pm dinner special you could imagine. I am not here to knock your idea of Florida, because both scenes I just described exist in North Florida. I mean what's wrong with eating your food truck burrito while your barefoot at a reasonable time so hard to get on board with? You have time for dessert and digestion before you catch those zzz's! This is a battle meant for another day. If you aren't into shredding the gnar or attending senior bingo, you may wonder what Florida has to offer other than concrete amusement parks. Rejoice my friends because I have a solution. Though it may not be topping your vacation brochures, Florida offers great places for paddle sports. These sports can be enjoyed by any age group. Are you a seasoned kayaker looking for a challenge? Opt to try paddle boarding instead for a great core workout that perfects your balancing skills. Are you more into the outdoors just to get a tan? Select a tandem kayak and make your buddy do the brunt of the work. I know this because I've been the recipient of this. As I paddled with all my might in Norway and wondered why we weren't going faster, my friend Randy sat behind me happily snapping photos enjoying the fruits of my labor. I did not learn my lesson, however, since here I am recommending his devious plan to all of you. Just make sure your friend takes the front seat and doesn't read this passage. You're welcome.\nThe Aloha state is paradise: sunny, laid-back, umbrella drinking mai-tai kind of paradise. Though many people come here to do nothing more than read their book on the island's 30 miles of beaches, Maui can also be an adventure hot spot. I mean literally. The highest peak on the island is the world's largest dormant volcano. The impressive Haleakala volcano never ceases to draw in outdoor enthusiasts from around the globe. Want to feel like Hawaiian royalty? Opt to catch a mesmerizing sunrise from it's peak. Haleakala National Park offers guests more than just the star of the show. The park offers beach access but my favorite swimming spot of the entire Maui trip was dunking into the Seven Sacred Pools, or the Pools of 'Ohe'o. If mermaids emerged from the depths, I would have thought it perfectly normal. I loved being able to climb up to a series of the falls and sit under the cool,flowing water as I looked out at the ocean. Some pools are more popular and accessible than others. As I mentioned, the pools flowed into the Pacific so that contrast in scenery was fantastic. Pack a picnic to make a great day of pool adventures. Swimming does not get more exotic than this. After you have your fill of swimming, continue hiking through Haleakala National Park to dry off. Your efforts will be rewarded when you reach a stunning bamboo forest. You may think you accidentally arrived on another continent with the landscape change.\nHaleakala is not to be missed and you can access it off of the famous Road to Hana. The road itself merits a few days to explore. Opt for a convertible so you can soak up as much roadside scenery as you can. If you are still craving big views, end your trip with a cherry on top. A helicopter tour of Maui may not be the most physical tour you can do, but I promise you will be feeling the adrenaline. The tour gives you access to views you would never be able to see otherwise. Get close to peaks and waterfalls alike. The views are breathtaking and you may just get the feeling that you are about to be dropped off in Jurassic Park.\nI can never be satisfied with doing everything just like everyone else. If I am going to a stereotypical tourist spot. I need to have an element that is different. While doing my research for antelope canyon, I found just what I was looking for to satisfy my stubborn self. Hidden Canyon Kayak was Arthur and the day trip through Antelope Canyon was my sword in the stone. At first I was a bit disappointed to see how large my group size was. In the past I have been spoiled with much smaller guide to tourist ratios in my travels. Once in the water, however, the problem dispersed as quickly as waves off my boat. The guides were good at accomodating people of all ability levels. As a frequent kayaker, I had a much faster pace than most. The guides recognized this, and made sure I did not feel restrained. Once we reached antelope canyon, we were released to explore the slot canyon on our own to a certain point. Again, I was happy to hear this since I much preferred being alone than attached to families I didn't know. It was a thrill to be able to skip, run, and even sing if I wanted to down these beautiful corridors. I loved this tour and would recommend it to anyone. The guides were relatable and I enjoyed my time talking to them. My only recommendation is if you are an experienced kayaker, let the guides know ahead of time and they will bring you a touring kayak. Compared to my kayak at home, the kayak I was given made me feel like I was moving through mud. Avoid this and request a more efficient boat. They just don't like to assign them to someone who is not experienced and has a higher chance to tip the narrow boats.\nHave you ever thought that mountain biking is cool, but it would be so much cooler to bike on Mars? I can't say i've been on this train of thought before, someone out there has been. To them I say, Mars is too far away. Sure you can keep fantasizing about the day that Richard Branson and Elon Musk unite like superheroes and create martian colonies complete with lotteries to fuel us basic humans with dreams of dual planet citizenship. Okay, maybe I have thought of this before. I digress. Biking in Page, Arizona may be the closest alternative. Really, the place is out of this world! So aren't my puns. Accessible right from town, I was told by a local to check out the Rimview trail. I stopped at a local shop, Lake Powell Paddleboards, and rented a mountain bike. A quick overview of a map and a heeding message of \"there are parts of the trail that if you get hurt or can't finish, no one can come get you\"and I was off. A little skeptical of my skill after my warning, I wasn't sure how my day would go. Quickly into the trail, my reservations disappeared. It was easy to with the beautiful desert landscape. The \"rimview\" gets its name for a very specific reason. In parts you were on the very edge of the trail with a steep drop off. If it got too hairy, I simply walked. It was my best option since I was alone and if I got hurt, I didn't want to think of the desolate potential situation. The views of Lake Powell were breathtaking. What blew me away was that I had the trail virtually to myself. In a busy tourist town, I came across only two people my whole time biking. The two people were locals at that. It was my escape from vacation. A step away to truly take in a place. This was not without hard work, however. The trail had its difficult moments and was best suited for at least intermediate riders. If you are new, you at least have the ability to walk any dangerous spots. The heat is also draining. A lot of water and snacks for energy are a must. I can honestly say my lunch was well earned this day."}

{"doc_id": "251", "text": "The latest in Jazz North East\u2019s series of Schmazz gigs at the Jazz Caf\u00e9 featured British guitarists Mike Walker and Stuart McCallum. All seats in the upstairs room were taken (two of the north east\u2019s finest six-stringers bagged prime seats) and the stage resembled the guitar section of your local musical instrument store. The Greater Manchester-based duo settled down to play the first of two mainly acoustic sets in a setting Walker later described as having \u2018a good vibe\u2019.\nThe material consisted of original compositions (a Schmazz prerequisite) and one or two standards. The opening number had an Americana feel to it, so it came as no surprise to learn it was Bill Frisell\u2019s Where Do We Go? Walker, a man with an impressive cv \u2013 the big bands of Mike Gibbs and Kenny Wheeler, stints with Julian Arguelles and Nikki Iles, to his latest Anglo American project, the Impossible Gentlemen \u2013 shuffled a set list at will, suggesting to McCallum they do \u2018Orpheus\u2019. A change of guitar, some retuning, a bit of banter and into Luiz Bonf\u00e1\u2019s Black Orpheus. This and the following number \u2013 All the Things You Are \u2013 exemplified Stuart McCallum\u2019s penchant for reharmonizing tunes. Dark tones, dense improvisations, Walker picking up on McCallum\u2019s initial foray, further solo invention, the seamless dovetailing of ideas.\nA Walker composition \u2013 Wallenda\u2019s Last Stand \u2013 inspired by the life story of a high wire walker\u2019s final, fatal, do or die journey and McCallum\u2019s The French Song illustrated their talents as tunesmiths. The second set heard McCallum\u2019s Beholden and Walker\u2019s Clock Maker. Walker introduced the latter number with a hilarious, true tale of his friend saxophonist Iain Dixon\u2019s father\u2019s clock making obsession. Imagine a house full of clocks \u2013 He made one every four minutes, said Walker \u2013 all primed to chime on the hour. It was Walker\u2019s mission in life when visiting Dixon Snr to leave before the cacophonous clock chorus struck up! A distinct folk strand ran through the second set, notably McCallum\u2019s tune inspired by a visit to the Shetlands and his authentic folk ballad Seasons. The one time student of Walker has gone on to work in a variety of contexts including a plum job with John Surman, tenure with the hip Cinematic Orchestra and work with Tim Garland\u2019s Northern Underground Orchestra (including an appearance at the Durham Miners\u2019 Gala a few years ago). This Schmazz gig was one for students of the guitar rather than one for the jazz guitar purist.\nEarlier, pianist Paul Taylor played a solo set in the downstairs bar. The Tyneside-based Taylor developed ideas from an impressionist palette, quietly applying complementary hues to an uncluttered canvas. The audience listened intently, some seemingly holding a breath, such was the silence during a half hour improvisation.\nNext month\u2019s Schmazz concert at the Jazz Caf\u00e9 departs from the usual last Tuesday in the month date. The double bill of Troyka and Pulcinella can be heard on Tuesday 15 July.\nGreat gig, very inspiring gig Mike!\nThoroughly enjoyable gig left the jazz cafe buzzing. Great tunes, great repartee, great music, great night."}

{"doc_id": "257", "text": "Amber Lilyestrom, an amazing branding and business strategist, dreamed of being a stay at home mama well before having a child. At 8 months after her daughter was born, Amber took a leap of faith, quitting her job with only ONE CLIENT! Amber knew that focusing her time and energy on her business was the only way it would grow, and quitting her 9-5 turned out to be the best decision because it led her to her KILLER business. She is passionate about branding and business strategy and hosts her own podcast, and a two-day conference for women who want to take their life and career to the next level.\nWe were so inspired by her fierce work ethic, and wanted to create a website that reflected her passion. Amber wanted her site design to be bold, elegant, and CLEAR to visitors on exactly who she is. Amber had strong content and we loved getting to design a gorgeous website around it. Go Live did not design her main logo, but we designed the Ignite Your Soul logo (pictured above!) for an upcoming event and had so much fun with it. Here's a HUGE CONGRATS to Amber on the launch of her new website, and for turning her dream into a reality.\n\"My entire life has transformed as a result of the choice to pursue my dream and make the leap to launch my business.\"\nAmber's story of courage and passion will inspire and encourage you in your own journey!\nAmber: I have always been fascinated with human behavior, psychology and really understanding why people do what they do. I have been equally obsessed with helping people breakthrough their fears and roadblocks to live a more fulfilling and joyful life. I grew up witnessing the people I love struggle and made it my goal early on to create a different way of life for myself so I could make a positive impact on the lives of others by showing them what I learned. What better way to take ownership of your life than to match your work with the sacred mission?\nAmber: I worked in collegiate athletics marketing for a decade and had the gift of contributing to the growth of a Division I athletics brand on a national scale. My career path there was incredibly entrepreneurial and I taught myself how to write sales copy, design websites and graphics and basically everything in between. I was also asked to teach at the university and mentor students throughout my career, both of these roles allowed me to hone and develop my craft as a coach.\nAmber: The answers do not live out there, they come from within. I've spent thousands of dollars on coaches and programs and live events only to be guided on back to my own truth. I do not regret one penny spent or mile walked on this path, though, as it has helped me to become even better at what I do and more committed to the bigger mission of my life.\nAmber: The funny thing about this question is that so many people DID tell me that \"Everything I need is already within me.\" But, I didn't listen because I had to go on my own quest to find my way home to myself. I am so grateful for all of the people who patiently and lovingly stood by me on this journey, I am certain I will need them to continue to remind me of this message, once again, down the path.\nGO LIVE: WHAT WAS THE MOMENT YOU HAD WHEN YOU SAID \"I SHOULD DO THIS\" OR WHAT MADE YOU TAKE THE LEAP INTO WORKING FOR YOURSELF?\nAmber: I had known that I wanted to be a work from home mama well before I was pregnant, only I didn't know HOW it was going to happen. After my own near-death experience (aka wakeup call) during our daughter's birth, I knew that it was time to get serious about making this dream come true. I launched my business 8 months after she was born and quit my job with just one client on the books (crazy!?), but I knew that if I could welcome in one client, more would come and focusing my time/energy on my business was the only way to help it grow. Four years later, I am so grateful for that courageous former version of me.\nGO LIVE: WHAT THINGS HAVE YOU GAINED, OR DO YOU HOPE TO GAIN, IN YOUR LIFE FROM FOLLOWING THIS DREAM?\nAmber: I have my life, my health, my husband (we retired him from his police career in 2017), the memories with our daughter that I haven't had to miss a minute of, sacred friendships with people I would have never met, time with the people I love the most and a deep sense of fulfillment and personal growth that comes with it. My entire life has transformed as a result of the choice to pursue my dream and make the leap to launch my business.\nAmber: I absolutely love your design work and the way you approach supporting visionaries like me in sharing our message and mission with the world. I so appreciate how you tend to the finite details while honoring the big vision and delivering a finished product that will make a massive impact. Our websites create a powerful experience for our future clients to feel fully witnessed as they take the next step on their journey. I am so thrilled with what we've created together."}
{"doc_id": "258", "text": "It was time to pack up camp and head north. Our drive to New Bern/Beaufort area was only 2 hours; allowing ample time to do some exploring!\nOur camping destination was Flanners Beach Campground, located in the Neuse River Recreation Area in eastern North Carolina. This campground sits on a bluff which overlooks Neuse River and only a half-hour drive to the quaint town of Beaufort, NC.\nWe made our way to our site which was perfect for us. It was a large with trees all around lending privacy. We were close to the bath house as well, very handy as there is no water/sewer service. After our site was set-up, it was back on the road for some adventure.\nTips: Bring your bikes as the trails are easy and beautiful. If it is summer, you may not want to count on cooling off in the river. The water would be considered not warm but hot and stays shallow for a long way out. It was a dismal experience.\nOur first stop in Beaufort was the North Carolina Maritime Museum. We learned about this museum at the Crystal Coast Visitor Center back in May 2016 on our New Bern adventure and was told it was a \u201cnot-to-miss\u201d museum for pirates fans!\nThe first thing we did when we arrived at the museum was watch a documentary on Blackbeard\u2019s life history (and that of other pirates), and his exploits in the waters off North Carolina. It was very well done and kept the kids interested to the very end. The best part? Artifacts from Blackbeard\u2019s Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge that we saw in the documentary are on display in the museum!\nHelen Aitken, a volunteer at the front desk, greeted us warmly and offered to get Drake and Mia set-up with a clipboard and pencil so they could participate in the museum scavenger hunt. She also mentioned to them that if they completed it, she would allow them to touch a REAL whale heart. What better motivation is there?\nThe museum is chock-full of interesting exhibits documenting life at lighthouses and lifesaving stations, the NC seafood industry, and motorboats through the years. The highlight, of course, was the artifacts from Blackbeard\u2019s wrecked flagship, Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge. You won\u2019t see treasure (we learned Blackbeard removed all the good stuff when he ran aground) , however, you will see cannons, grenades, belt buckles and beads. Truly amazing to see!\nWhen the kids were done with their scavenger hunt they went back to see Ms. Aitken. True to her word, she had them follow her to the whale heart exhibit. As she was telling us interesting facts about whales (did you know that the size of heart a whale is born with is the same size they\u2019ll have as an adult?), a little crowd gathered around. Next, she opened up the display case and allowed everyone to gently touch the whale heart. Incredible!\nNext, she pulled out a small jar of whale oil. Of course we all know that it was used for centuries for heating but I wasn\u2019t as educated that it was also used in the auto industry. She rubbed a tiny amount on our hands to feel how incredibly silky the consistency was. It did have a pungent odor which I did identify as smelling before. Perhaps when my grandfather and father worked on vehicles many years ago. Ms. Aiken said that if you left it on for awhile the smell becomes similar to coconut oil. Not sure that I got that, but I can say it softened my skin!\nTip: Don\u2019t forget to walk across the street to visit Harvey W. Smith Watercraft Center where they teach boat-building for all ages.\nBy this time we were starving! On a recommendation from the Aitken\u2019s, we made our way to Clawson\u2019s 1905 Restaurant & Pub for lunch; located on the main drag; Front Street. Housed in the former Clawson\u2019s Grocery building, the owners display historical memorabilia on the walls to help preserve this piece of Beaufort\u2019s history.\nThe Aitken\u2019s had mentioned the Seafood Bisque as being a \u201cmust-try\u201d so we got a bowl to share. This creamy based soup with loads of scallops and shrimp was definitely a hit with Drake & Mia! I found it to be delicious as well. Too soon the bowl was empty and our main courses arrived.\nI had the Flounder plate; a generous portion of lightly fried-golden fish paired with French fries. Clawson\u2019s offers a kids menu and had a Fried Shrimp plate for kids which my seafood-loving kids loved. Troy had the Angus Burger, cooked perfectly and also delicious.\nNow that we had filled our bellies, it was time to check out one more recommended place in Beaufort; the Old Burying Grounds. Located just a couple- minutes walk from Fleet Street, it is definitely worth a visit. We paid a quarter to get a brochure on the \u201cGrave Sites of Interest\u201d and started our tour.\nThe graves here date back to the early 1700\u2019s and believed to house victims as far back as the Indian Wars with the Coree and Neusiok Indians. There are many other old graves with the oldest legible date being from 1756.\nMany graves hold ship captain, soldiers and local residents, however, there are several graves that have unique stories to be told. One of the most colorful is \u201cGirl in Barrel of Rum.\u201d A young girl went to visit London with her father in early 1700\u2019s and died on the voyage home. The father didn\u2019t want to break his promise to his wife of bringing his daughter home so instead of burying her at sea, he purchased a barrel of rum from the captain and placed his daughter in it so she could be buried at home.\nAfter our visit, we returned to the living and enjoyed an ice cream while checking out the numerous quaint stores lining the waterfront.\nOur last stop of the day was to Cape Lookout National Seashore Visitor Center. Here, Drake and Mia picked up their Junior Ranger books and we were able to learn more about what we could expect on our day at both Shackleford Banks and Cape Lookout National Seashore.\nTips: Island Express Ferry Service does operate out of Beaufort, however, during my research, I realized that we would have to choose one destination; either Cape Lookout National Seashore or Shackleford Banks (home to more than 100 wild horses). The other deciding factor not to take the ferry out of Beaufort was the trip to Cape Lookout would be a 3 \u00bd hour round-trip! If you want to save time and hit both destinations on the same day, my recommendation is to use Island Express Ferry Service out of Harkers Island (about 1 hour drive from Flanners Beach Campground).\nNext up? Our amazing day at Shackleford Banks, Cape Lookout National Seashore and a quick trip to Oriental, boating capitol of North Carolina. It was one of my favorite days of the whole trip!"}
{"doc_id": "259", "text": "As her favourite colour is purple I knew I had to use that colour. A month or so ago I found some purple sugar and white sugar pearls. I wanted to do a kid cake that was elegant given her age. That was as far as I got until the morning of the day everyone was coming. Talk about a decorating block! I just couldn\u2019t think of anything. Fortunately on the walk with the dogs I got an idea. And it had to be done quickly as I had an hour to do this. Yikes!\nNot only does she like purple, she likes butterflies so I decided to go with that. I whipped up some buttercream icing like I did for these cupcakes. Before I added the purple I scooped some white into a decorating bag.\nCarefully place the top layer on and brush any loose crumbs off.\nIce the whole cake smoothing as best you can. Isn\u2019t this a great purple?\nNext I used the white frosting to outline the flowers and butterfly. Finally I got the consistency right and it flowed like it should.

People are starting to choose their side. It looks like most people are against to this statement.\nNemiroff posted 4 arguments to the agreers part.\nNemiroff, historybuff and 3 visitors agree.\nYiyi, chasediedrich1, NPW, DrMrDaniel, chemikilsm0ke and 3 visitors disagree.\nwhy is it that your entire post deflected to the democrats and completely dodged the topic of the thread, the contents of the actual Republican memo?\nis it because the contents of that memo themselves are indefensible?\nmy entire opening post explained why it was fake. so your opening jab is a miss.\nNunez used half truths to lie to the American people. regardless of the damage that should spark far more outrage.\nthe damage was to sources and methods of intelligence gathering. it makes intelligence gathering harder for our professionals. do you think you as a civilian would notice the damage? did you notice the snowden damage? of course not. what were you expecting the damage to be? an instant invasion? I think you are making arbitrary excuses to avoid laying blame on your party no matter how badly they slapped you and the American people.\nI love how democrats always dissmis the memo as a fake but rarely point out why it's fake. I also remember that democrats stated that the memo would cause major problems and liberal media cites were buzzing with why releasing the memo would bring terrible consequences, yet none of that happened. It's almost as if there was something in that memo democrats didn't want released.\nanyone have any argument for why it wasn't garbage?\nfrankly garbage isn't strong enough. it was outright lies to try to undermine an investigation into potential treasonous activities. when the investigation leads to more charges I hope they investigate Nunes as well for his willful attempt to cover it up.\nit represented the Steele dossier as the only evidence when it was supported by numerous independent sources.\nit said the fbi hide the fact that one of its leads was started for a partisan purpose, but they openly told the judge that, who then judged it valid.\nit forgot to mention that the warrant was renewed several times, meaning it was providing valid intelligence in the eyes of the court. which included numerous republician judges who approved it.\nthis political farce needs to end. cherry picking from classified data to build a false narrative to deceive the American people, there need to be treason charges brought on some. starting with Devon Nunez. if anyone is colluding, it's him."}

Why not let InDevR\u2019s team of scientists do it for you?\nThe single radial immunodiffusion assay is used to quantify the concentration of antigen in a given sample relative to a standard of the same antigen. In short, an agarose gel is infused with reference antisera and holes are punched in the gel. Antigen is placed in the holes and diffuses into the agarose. The distance that the antigen diffuses into the agarose is measured as a precipitate \u201cring\u201d in the gel after staining. The ring diameter is proportional to the quantity of the antigen present in a given well.\nThe SRID assay is applied across the influenza vaccine industry. It is widely used to determine the potency of the hemagglutinin content of vaccines prior to release of the product.\nInDevR has scientists trained and experienced in performing the SRID assay to specifications put forward by the FDA. This assay can either act as a calibration for the VaxArray assay or can be performed for stand-alone potency determination. VaxArray influenza Potency Assays have been shown to correlate well with results from SRID assays.\nContact InDevR to connect with our scientists for help in defining the testing plan for your samples."}

{"doc_id": "268", "text": "Mercedes has lifted the veil and presented the new X-Class. Mercedes X-Class is the company\u2019s first large scale production luxury pickup and we reveal all its secrets, including the prices for the German market. The X-Class will be available in Europe, Latin America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. No USA.\nThere it is, the Mercedes of the pickups. Following the 2016 reveal of the close to production concept, the series X-Class has now been revealed in South Africa. Sales start this November with a basic price of 37,294 euros.\nIt is widely known that Mercedes is buying the technical base from the Renault Nissan Group, the X-Class is based on the Nissan Navara and is also being built at Nissan\u2019s European headquarters in Barcelona. In contrast to other \u201cbadge engineering\u201d models such as the practically identical duo Mitsubishi L200 and Fiat Fullback, Mercedes has \u2013 having learnt its lesson from the experience with the Citan \u2013 heavily updated the Nissan Navara donor base and created an unique interior and exterior design.\nOn the technical side, the ladder frame and the drivetrains are primarily identical. In addition, the basic cell of the cabin and individual body parts such as the doors are identical. Nevertheless, the Mercedes X-Class is a completely new car, from a design stand point.\nThe front is dominated by the radiator grill with powerful big star and two cross chrome bars, the headlights with LED daytime running lights are smaller and more aggressive. Depending on the equipment variant, the lower apron is decorated with a large chrome surround, lacquered in car paint or molded in dyed plastic, which is more robust. At the rear, we notice the extremely narrow high-angle lights, an unusual styling idea in the pick-up camp. Mercedes is fitting a rear bumper to every X-Class, depending on the variant painted in car paint or in chrome, \u201cnaked\u201d commercial vehicle variants as with other manufacturers will not exist.\nIn the chassis department, Mercedes has made major changes to the Nissan Navara. Wider gauge and its own optimized for road use will bring a considerable improvement compared to the Nissan. This is to be desired, because the Navara chassis is despite all coil springs quite rustic and bumpy. On the other hand, Nissan technology can be used again for engines, at least for the time being. The two variants of the 2.3-liter turbodiesel with single- and twin turbocharging (163/190 hp) are known from the Navara, in the Mercedes they operate under the designation X 220 d and X 250 d. Both variants are available with rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive and come as standard with a six-speed manual gearbox, while the X 250 d is also offered with a seven-speed automatic. The all-wheel-drive variants have a switchable off-road 50/50% traction lock switch and optionally a rear axle differential lock.\nIn contrast to the prospective main competitor, the VW Amarok V6, Mercedes will only offer a V6 variant from 2018 onwards. Powered by Mercedes\u2019 own three-liter V6 diesel, the X 350 d with 258 hp and 550 Nm will be the most potent midsize pickup ever. The X 350 d is equipped as standard with the seven-speed 7G-Tronic automatic and is available with permanent all-wheel drive only.\nParticularly much work has been done in the interior design, with hardly one part lifted from the Nissan. From the Navara was taken only the small switch unit in front of the gear lever, from which all-wheel drive / support, hillside control and the rear axle lock can be operated. Otherwise everything is new. This begins with the door panels and handles and continues over the entire dashboard, which is now covered side-to-side with a full-surface mid-section plastic ornament. The rotary push button for the Comand system is integrated into the center console, the instruments with round screens and the central info display and the multi-function steering wheel are the same as in the current Mercedes SUV line-up. Many details, such as the control panel of the climate control system or the design of the round fan nozzles, are known from the Mercedes GLA. In addition, Mercedes promises an unusually high individualization potential for pickup conditions with various color and decor variations. Despite all this, the interior designers had obviously no easy task with the constructive specifications of the base. Individual details such as the fan nozzles or the Comand controller have the effect of being retrofitted.\nWith the assistance and media options Mercedes X-Class takes full advantage of the brand\u2019s parts bin. The X-Class already has the eCall system, which is required from 2018, and also the technical prerequisites for online services. For this reason, the optional me-connect system can be used to access the vehicle via a smartphone, for example, to determine the location or to check the tank content and tire pressure. In addition to the voice-controlled Comand Online, Mercedes also offers the 20 USB and 20 CD audio systems from the other series for the X-Class. Tracking, traffic signs and active brake assist are on board as well as a trailer stability program, cruise control and LED headlights. In addition to the rear-view camera, a 360-degree camera system with Birdview mode is available at an extra charge.\nMercedes will offer the X-Class in three different equipment variants, which also differ externally. Base is the X-Class Pure with a dark plastic apron. In addition, Mercedes offers the X-Class Progressive, in which the apron is lacquered in car paint. With its chrome apron, the top equipment X-Class Power can easily be recognized. The upcoming V6 is only offered in this version. In addition, Mercedes already plans to offer a pickup-typical accessories program such as a hardtop and loading area cover or off-road accessories at the start of sales.\nThe market launch of the X-Class will take place in Germany and Europe in November 2017, followed by South Africa and Australia in early 2018 and Argentina and Brazil in early 2019. On the export markets, a petrol engine with 165 hp will also be part of the program. There will also be slightly less pompous versions available. The X-Class 350 d with the V6 diesel will come in mid-2018. According to Mercedes, the demand for particularly luxurious and comfortable midsize pickups is steadily rising, which is why the X-Class, unlike the competition, will only be available as a double cab with an already comprehensive basic equipment. Real workhorses with minimized rustic equipment are not on the program for Germany. In the face of the basic price of 37,294 for the X class 220 d Pure with manual transmission (for comparison: the Navara prices for the 2.3-liter double cab start at 31.110 Euro) may be assumed that for the top model X-Class 350 D will cost around 60,000 euros.\n\u041d\u0430\u0448 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0431 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u0441 \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e HOMTOM HT20 Pro \u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440."}

For some it might be extra practice. It might be challenging them to reach their full potential.\nOne of the ways that we highlight what the children are learning is through a portfolio celebration is a time for a child to with their parents look at the goals they have set and show off and celebrate their achievements.\nAs their confidence develops, as their competence develops we celebrate each success and advancement that they have.\nWe instill the habits of mind and practices of creative and critical thought.\nThrough a variety of creative opportunities at each developmental stage, Willowstone Academy is actively developing a creativity model that supports the intentional and individual understanding of creativity in each child.\nCritical thinking is a fabulous way for children to stretch their thinking. They have an opportunity to come up with their answer, it\u2019s not about being the right answer, it is about making a reasoned judgment based on criteria.\nWe embed critical thinking across the curriculum so there are critical challenges in every subject we teach."}

We were the first clinic in South Africa to receive the Dermapen 4. So what makes the Dermapen 4 so much better than the Dermapen 3 or any other microneedling device?\nDermapen 4 has a 16 needle cartridge instead of just 12 needles, reaching an inflammatory response at a much quicker rate.\nThe Dermapen 4 generates 47.9% more micro-channels than Dermapen 3 and 104% more micro-channels than any counterfeit device.\nThe Dermapen 4 generates 1,920 puncture channels per second, which means we can almost double the amount of serums and actives that we needle into the skin per treatment, than before.\nThe additional 620 micro-channels makes the treatment much quicker and more comfortable than before.\nDermapen 4 is the only microneedling device with a dedicated scar setting and protocols for revision of deep, atrophic scars; including surgical, burn contracture, striae and post-acne scars. Needle penetration can now be increased up to 3.0mm.\nAOVN technology, automatically calibrates the motor speed, pressure and penetration for targeted precision.\nThe Dermapen 4 is safer than other microneedling devices, no dragging or pulling of the skin.\nOnly Dermapen 4 features a unique, medical-grade silicone seal and fluid guard. The external cartridge is fortified with a specialised fluid guard that prevents cross contamination to the outer cartridge shell. Safety First!\nSpecialised retention valves relieve the build-up of procedural pressure within the Dermapen 4 needle cartridge. The effect prevents fluid build-up within the needle cavity. The vacuum-like sensation removes the risk of cross contamination whilst ensuring pressure-free contact to the skin during a procedure.\nTop: Medical grade numbing cream applied for 20 \u2013 30 minutes, we then needle medical grade serums and actives into the skin via the Dermapen 4 device. Bottom: An Alginate Mask is applied and connected to our IonZyme Machine. A medical grade concealer is applied to speed up recovery and cover any immediate post treatment redness.\nThe Dermapen is an award winning micro-needling device.\nWe use the Dermapen 4 to create safe pathways to deliver quality anti-aging serums deep into the skin.\nNew collagen and elastin are now being produced by the body; tightening the skin and healing scars, fine lines and literally keeping the skin young and full of volume.\nWhat is the Dermapen 4 good for?\nSkin conditions: Treat pigmentation, skin texture, oily skin, acne and sun damaged skin.\nThe numbing cream that we apply is a 30% Lidocaine medical-grade numbing cream that is only available at medical practices. Should your skincare \u201cclinic\u201d, not have an overseeing doctor, chances are that you are not receiving the appropriate numbing cream (only a 2% Lidocaine), which can make this treatment uncomfortable.\nThe concentrated actives in the mask are delivered into the skin immediately after a microneedling treatment to instantly cool and soothe the skin and to improve the skins health complexion.\nThe IonZyme machine introduces the use of Pulsed Iontophoresis; the use of a specifically pulsed electrical current to facilitate penetration of vitamins into the cells.\nImmediately post this microneedling treatment, we apply an Alginate mask over the face. We then connected it to our IonZyme Machine to send an electrical current via the mask. This reduces inflammation to speed up recovery. The mask itself is infused with skin corrective peptides and anti-inflammatory actives which makes it the perfect compliment for the skin after a Dermapen treatment.\nNatural Aesthetics is not a spa of \u201cbeauty salon\u201d; we are a medical practice.\nOur Therapists are specially trained to administer medical microneedling and IonZyme Machine treatments safely and correctly.\nEach of our Therapists have also received special training by Dr Wade Merchant to further ensure that our patients receive the safest and most effective treatments.\nFor the month of April only: Receive a Face & Neck Dermapen 4 Treatment + An Alginate Mask + IonZyme Machine Treatment for only R1,500 (all inclusive).\nOR call us on 021 433 0967."}

Thanks Francesca, you're amazing, I love them! thank you!\n\"I received the most beautiful gift today. And this little story of its arrival on my doorstep needs to be shared.\nA few months back I was travelling in country NSW in Australia and was scheduled to do an event on the last night of my stay. It was cold.\nSo I pulled myself together (like I do) to be of service and speak on all things food and nutrition to a small group of people. In the audience there was one shining light that stood out to me. She radiated so much light and we connected after I talked. She shared with an extremely vulnerable heart, her health concerns.\nAnd I offered my support in the coming weeks.\nWe connected every few days and I helped her see where she could improve. Our connection was in stolen moments and after she felt confident in the knowledge I had shared, I gave her space to absorb all that she\u2019d learnt to she could put all into practice.\nWhat I didn\u2019t know, in the weeks following was that she had had such profound shifts.\nHer symptoms lifted, her energy returned, her ability to feel joy crept back into her life.\nYou see, when asked why do I coach, the answer is always the same.....to help people return to self. To feel joy again.\nToday, I received this beautiful gift, all the way from Milan. This beautiful human had this Pink Kunzite necklace made for me. I had truly made my day and I\u2019m so grateful. Who would have thought that a random act of service can create such immense love and joy for all.\"\n\"I don\u2019t know how I found Francesca but I am so glad I did. Lots of thought and love goes into everything she makes. It\u2019s not jewelry. It\u2019s so much more.\nyou work together to pick which kind of specimen to use.\nShe might know right away or you might know. Or you might have to decide between a few. But she works with the crystals and narrows it down.\nThen You pick from her collection which stone you feel drawn to. In my case, I let her tell me what I needed. She picked 6 pieces of Rubellite tourmaline.\nAnd then I picked the from that. It\u2019s absolutely perfect.\nAnd I got it the day if the new moon so it could not have worked out better.\nThank you so much Giardinoblu Jewellery Milan!!\"\n\"Working with Francesca was an absolute dream. I had been wanting to transform a beloved herkimer diamond into a pendant and, after purchasing several jewelry pieces from Francesca and seeing the level of care she puts into her work, I knew she was the only I would entrust my gemstone to.\nFrancesca loves gemstones and respects their energy, and that was very important to me when choosing someone.\nFrancesca made the whole creation process simple. She first shared some designs and, once I liked them, I sent her my stone via courier. Once she had it, she got to work, showing me every step of the way, and seeking my approval before moving forward.\nI loved how she kept me regularly informed of where we were in the process and listened to my observations. She was kind and courteous at every step of the way, and ended up creating a jewel I will treasure forever.\nI couldn't be happier with the necklace Francesca created for me. It's perfect in every way, and beams with positive energy.\"\nPhotographer, Stylist & Visual Strategist, Marcela Macias Photography."}

{"doc_id": "290", "text": "African/Lake Malawi cichlids have very specialised feeding habits that have been adapted so that they can survive in their natural habitat. However aquarists tend to make it easier for themselves by getting readily prepared flakes and pellets. But you will have to take into account whether your fish are herbivores or \u2018piscivores\u2019 (feed on other fish). Mbuna species are normally herbivore, so they will mainly feed on the algae that grows on rocks, so they must be fed on plant food. These fish cannot digest animal fat and will suffer from indigestion if fed on it.\nOn the other hand most Lake Malawi cichlids will eat small crustaceans like Brine Shrimps.\nA lot of cichlid breeders make up their own homemade food, made from chopped up shrimp and peas.\nThaw out the shrimps and peas and mince them finely in a food mixer, then add the vitamin drops. Finally pour in the dissolved gelatine. The gelatine will bind the mixture, producing a thick paste after it has cooled. Place the paste into a freezer bag, flatten and then freeze. Now this nutritious fish food can easily be cut up into convenient pieces, and given to your fish.\nA wide range of foods are commercially available, like flakes and pellets. It has been noticed that cichlids feed very enthusiastically on flakes, while pellets sink to the bottom, so any other inhabitants like catfish can get it. The choice is yours.\nA further important source of food for your African cichlids, are frozen foods like white and black mosquito larvae, brine shrimps and krill.\nMixes including beef heart and frozen RED mosquito larvae are not suitable for Lake Malawi Cichlids.\nHow often you feed your Lake Malawi cichlids depends on their age. Fry (Newly born fish) must be fed more frequently and in smaller portions than older fish. Fry should literally be swimming in food in order to grow quickly and develop properly.\nHerbivores are more used to feeding in small portions over the day, so feeding them once a day will not be enough. And you must take care to only put in the right amount of food. It should take about 1 minute for all of the food to be eaten.\nAdult cichlids should be fed 2-3 times a day while the fry should be fed 5-7 times a day. If the fish are fed regularly then their aggression should be reduced.\nNever feed your fish just after you have switched the light on as they will need reach their full levels of daytime activity. The African cichlids rest at night and it takes them about thirty minutes to become fully active. And for similar reasons, you should not give them their final feed just before turning the light out.\nIf you don\u2019t think that you will be able to feed your fish at the correct times each day, then you should consider installing an automatic feeding machine.\nIt is important not to overfeed your fish as your cichlids will consume anything, and in huge quatities if they can, which can harm their health. Healthy African Cichlids will always await their food eagerly.\nIf an adult cichlid is eating poorly or refusing food then don\u2019t feed them at all for one full day afterwards as it may be overfed. If they still fail to eat after the day off, then they may have contracted a disease.\nThey are. Were they cichlids or tropical fish? Thank you for your comment by the way.\nI love aquarium fish and used to keep quite a few of them. They are a lot of fun and beautiful to watch."}

But this really has got to make people wake up and realize how bad things have really gotten. The findings in New York State after an independent study of 24 supplements offered in Target, Walmart, Walgreens and GNC reveal a gross negligence and outright mockery of honesty and integrity. The state\u2019s Attorney General found these items didn\u2019t even contain the main ingredient stated and instead were chock full of cheap rice and other not so healthy fillers.\nThe attorney general\u2019s team tested 24 products in total. Roughly four out of five supplements tested did not contain the medicinal herbs they were supposed to, and were instead rife with \u201ccheap fillers like powdered rice, asparagus and houseplants, and in some cases substances that could be dangerous to those with allergies,\u201d according to a New York Times report.\nWalgreens Ginseng supplement labeled as something to increase endurance and vitality was simply garlic and rice powder. Ginkgo biloba supplement from Walmart was found to actually be powdered radish, houseplants and wheat despite the fact that its label said it was wheat and gluten-free.\nWalgreens is pulling the problematic supplements from shelves. Walmart plans to reach out to suppliers and take necessary action to ensure the safety of its customers. GNC says the company is willing to cooperate following this investigation, but stood behind its own supplements and testing system. Target so far has not issued a comment.\nThe attorney general\u2019s office conducted its test by purchasing 78 bottles of the four retailers\u2019 top brands from a dozen Walmart, Target, GNC, and Walgreens stores in the state.\nHealth care experts have warned about the potential dangers of the unregulated supplement industry for some time, including in a 2012 review published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Certain ingredients, like high amounts of caffeine, pose risks for certain consumers.\nConsider getting your supplements from a reliable source like Natural News where you know it is being tested for not only containing that which the label lists but also to be free from toxins and heavy metals.

Red shows superheated gas held together by magnetic fields. The time sequence lasts only 80 seconds and yet reveals tremendous amounts of gas leaving the Sun.\nA detailed study of a huge solar eruption reveals that a series of smaller explosions combined in a domino effect to fuel the blast.\nThe findings improve understanding of the Sun's most powerful events and could lead to better forecasting of the tempests, researchers said.\nScientists studied data collected from a radiation flare on the Sun on July 15, 2002. The eruption, ranked as an X-7, was one of the most powerful in recent times. The flare was accompanied by a coronal mass ejection, which is a colossal discharge of electrified gas called plasma. The event was 5,000 million times more powerful than an atomic bomb.\nScientists don't know exactly what triggers such eruptions. They are associated with strong magnetic fields, however, and emanate from sunspots, which are cooler regions of the Sun that correspond to bottled-up magnetic energy.\n\"Sunspots are at the surface of the Sun, and are essentially the footprints of the magnetic field,\" explained Louise Harra of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London. \"The magnetic field reaches into the outer atmosphere in the same way as for example a bar magnet has a magnetic field around it.\"\nResearchers had thought the big eruptions are created when magnetic field lines from the core of a sunspot become tangled and reconnect high in solar atmosphere, or corona. The new study contradicts that assumption.\nX-7 flare started when plasma from below the Sun's surface broke suddenly through.\n\"Below the surface of the Sun a dynamo process is working creating magnetic field,\" Harra explained in an email interview. \"When this becomes buoyant it can rise to the surface of the Sun, and into the atmosphere.\"\nThe plasma collided with a strong magnetic field at the surface, and the interaction triggered release of \"phenomenal amounts of energy,\" the researchers concluded. There were three eruptions, each triggering the next.\nThe gas was heated to 36 million degrees Fahrenheit (20 million Celsius) before being flung up into the solar atmosphere at 90,000 mph (40 kilometers per second).\n\"We have observed the flows of hot gas for the first time, enabling us to see that several small flares combine to create a major explosion,\" Harra said. \"This may eventually enable us to predict large flares before they erupt.\"\nNot all solar flares are accompanied by coronal mass ejections, and nobody knows for sure why.\n\"It must be a combination of the magnetic field strength and the magnetic configuration that will allow field lines to be opened and hence the release of gas,\" Harra said.\nThe observations were made with SOHO spacecraft, a joint project of NASA and the European Space Agency. The results were presented last week at a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society."}

Yuck.\nI will say, though, it's nice to be alone up here in my room in the middle of the day with some items I have come to count as dearest companions - my Bible, journal, daily devotion book, thankful journal, and a collection of gel pens.\nCurrently, I am reading Jesus Calling, by Sarah Young. Filled with lovely little reminders of God's presence and His love for me, this daily devotional helps focus my thoughts either to start my day right or rest peacefully during the night.\nAlso by my side today is God's Wisdom for a Mother's Heart, by Bobbie Wolgemuth. This has provided hours and hours of conversation starters for the bi-monthly mentoring group I help lead at my church. Though only 128 pages in length, we have used this book for more than a year. The girls in Moms to Moms meet the first and second Wednesday nights of the month, a sort of round-table, open forum where no topic is off limits, but mostly parenting and reassuring that they're going to make it. We study the Word, pray, laugh, cry, teach each other, and we are all growing.\nMy co-leaders and I agree these young ladies with their children around them are our heroes. Represented are single and married moms, working outside and inside their homes, public/private/homeschooling moms...you name it, we've got it. This is one group we hate to miss. A gift from God. Truly.\nMy thankful journal is simply a little leather-bound book where I record the gifts God has given me. Eucharisto. Thanks. One Thousand Gifts. 10,000 reasons. Why write them down? Because I dare not forget the goodness of God. In the remembering and the acknowledging I am overwhelmed with reassurance that God is my provider, comforter, healer, friend, joy, strength, and so much more. I am much less likely to lose my focus and wander if I am remembering God's deeds and giving thanks.\nLast, but certainly not least, is my personal journal. It may as well be my heart on paper. This is where it all comes pouring forth to be sorted, processed, saved or discarded. You know, keep the good and throw out the chaff. That's what the journal is for - it is fearsome, yet necessary. Necessary for me anyways.\nThere are a few more books I could talk about. Don't know about you, but I read several at once. These I mentioned were simply the lucky ones to be carried into the sick bed with me today.\nDo you have reading materials you count as \"dearest companions\"? What are they and why are they special to you?\nI also have the Jesus Calling devotional, Karen had mentioned it a long time ago, and I finally got it. I've really enjoyed it, it's definitely helped me focus in on that 'personal' time.."}

{"doc_id": "301", "text": "SEF Canada is working with artisanal miners in Ecuador to eliminate mercury in gold processing while developing local economies. SEF Canada\u2019s managing director Suzette McFaul discusses the project\u2019s community-driven approach to developing more sustainable practices in artisanal gold mining.\nMiners in the Clean Gold project are transitioning from mercury to cyanide-based processing methods. Image courtesy of SEF Canada.\nClean Gold has partnered with the University of British Columbia and others to form a technical \"dream team\". Image courtesy of SEF Canada.\nArtisanal miners often struggle with the brutal economics of small-scale production and accessing markets. Image courtesy of SEF Canada.\nMcFaul with a worker on-site in Ecuador.\nOn 16 August, the Minamata Convention on Mercury entered into force, marking the culmination of a years-long effort to come up with an international response to the shared threat of mercury exposure.\nWhile mercury has been used in industrial processes for hundreds of years, its extreme toxicity poses massive public health risks. Mercury poisoning can cause irreparable brain damage and organ failure, and low-level exposure is a significant cause of premature deaths.\nThe Minamata Convention, named after the Japanese city that has been living for decades with the consequences of a mass mercury poisoning, brings with it tighter controls for the handling of mercury in industry, as well as provisions for what it calls the \u201cphase-out and phase-down of mercury use in products and processes\u201d.\nIt also means renewed scrutiny on the use of mercury in artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) in many countries, and artisanal gold mining in particular. Mercury is used extensively in ASM operations, and often in highly unsafe domestic conditions, to process ore and recover gold.\nBut for small-scale miners working with simple tools and lacking the deep pockets, greater pressure to stop using mercury hasn\u2019t changed the economic fundamentals of their trade. Technical limitations mean that recovery rates are low and the grey market buyers of their gold, often jewellers, offering far below spot value. \u201cAnd that\u2019s if they don\u2019t get mugged on the way in a cash-based society,\u201d says McFaul.\nAfter being invited to southern Ecuador\u2019s El Oro province in 2014 to see how SEF\u2019s economic development model might help artisanal mining communities, McFaul established Clean Gold Community Solutions (Clean Gold) to take a more holistic approach to improving ASM standards in the region.\nThe company has partnered with artisanal miners, along with a technical \u2018dream team\u2019 led by the University of British Columbia, to make the transition away from mercury processing, while also taking on the upgrade of a local gold processing plant to refine the miners\u2019 products and instilling business development skills to empower the miners as business owners.\nThe plant, which McFaul says should be up and running \u201caround next week\u201d, will switch out mercury for cyanide in the recovery process, as the latter breaks down much more quickly if released. But the partnership, McFaul stresses, is about more than just replacing a harmful industrial element; it\u2019s about building new, sustainable systems centred around the plant.\nIn turn, transparency around processing methods and environmental performance facilitates access to markets that will offer close to spot prices for the miners\u2019 gold, rather than the 40-60% of spot price that McFaul says they get from grey market buyers.\nAt the heart of Clean Gold\u2019s model is prioritising the economic and social health of the whole community that surrounds ASM operations. This starts with only partnering with miners who have invited the company to do so, and developing the local economy is part of the deal.\n\u201cThe community has to buy in and the community has to win,\u201d says McFaul. \u201cThere\u2019s a community foundation that comes out of every Clean Gold project. \u201cThe community has to agree, and the miners agree, that part of that community foundation will go into an SEF model to help all the other people in the community.\nThe approach aims to be the polar opposite of the exploitative, opaque relationships that can characterise mining communities\u2019 interactions with large-scale mining companies. Putting the reins in the hands of the community helps create a virtuous cycle that is key to the wider economic development plan, even if a hands-off approach presents its own challenges.\nClean Gold is keen to expand its methods to ASM communities around the world. Plans are already in place to set up another project in Ecuador next year, and McFaul is hoping that the current plant upgrade and community development scheme will be a strong showcase to help sell the concept to prospective future investors.\nIf the money can be found, there is apparently no shortage of demand for the Clean Gold model. The company has already visited Guyana, and McFaul says invitations have been extended from neighbouring Colombia, as well as Kenya and Mali.\nCertainly there are challenges still to come. If the model is to be a true success on its own terms, it will be vital that miners and local families are as happy with the profit-sharing arrangement as the investors. But if the project in El Oro Province can make its environmental, ethical and business case, it could set a progressive template for cleaning up artisanal gold mining while also encouraging sustainable growth in communities that often live well below the poverty line."}
{"doc_id": "302", "text": "Starting XI Prediction: Solskjaer to keep 4-3-3 formation with Lingard, Rashford, and Martial leading the attack against PSG?\nManchester United return to UEFA Champions League action against Paris Saint-Germain at Old Trafford on Tuesday evening. It is what the Theatre of Dreams is made for, European nights under the floodlights. Last season, United made it to the same stage of the competition, losing to Sevilla and exiting the competition. This season, under the management of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, things may go a bit different for the Red Devils. Confidence is high and United are undefeated in 11 matches, winning ten and drawing one.\nNow is perhaps the best time to face the French champions as Neymar is out of the match and striker, Edinson Cavani limped out of Saturday\u2019s 1-0 victory over Bordeaux. PSG are a competent team but playing in France, they do not really have much competition which may be a negative ahead of this game, as United have been challenged in every match they have played, showing the difference between the Premier League and French football.\nThe Spanish number one was rarely tested against Fulham at Craven Cottage on Saturday but when he was, he was at his best. There are suggestions that the goalkeeper is calling for a \u00a3350,000 per week wage to sign a new contract at United, which is fair considering that he is the player who has been the difference for United \u2013 more often than not. He seems players like Alexis Sanchez on a high wage, yet in terms of what he offers United, De Gea offers so much more.\nUnited have managed to keep two clean sheets in their last two matches, which shows that some things have changed for United under Solskjaer. Ashley Young and Victor Lindelof were rested against Fulham, with the \u2018ice man\u2019 suffering from a knock. I expect both will be back against PSG with Luke Shaw keeping his place and Eric Bailly partnering Lindelof, which has seen both players in good form recently. Solskjaer has Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and possibly Marcos Rojo to select also, keeping options open.\nUnited\u2019s best midfield will be tested against PSG on Tuesday. Ander Herrera, Nemanja Matic, and Paul Pogba. Both Herrera and Matic allow Pogba to play further forward, which has seen the Frenchman play some good football recently, also seeing him score eight goals and five assists in his last ten matches under Solskjaer. This United midfield has the form, the ability and the experience to work the magic against PSG at the Theatre of Dreams.\nMarcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard were both rested in the 3-0 victory over Fulham at the weekend, meaning they will both be fresh to face PSG at Old Trafford. Anthony Martial played 70 minutes against Fulham, scoring a sublime goal, also getting an assist, which will mean his confidence will be high ahead of the Champions League match. These three, on their day, can be devastating to any team. If United manage to keep a clean sheet at home, the quarter-finals could be set for United this season.\nPreview: U23\u2019s out to fight for their futures against Reading?\nWhere did it all go wrong for Luke Shaw?"}

{"doc_id": "305", "text": "When people ask me what my favorite horror film is, I guess they would expect me to say \u201cHalloween\u201d or \u201cThe Exorcist.\u201d And while I do love those movies and they, along with \u201cPsycho\u201d for instance, would be in my top-five of the genre, I say that my favorite in the genre is definitely \u201cThe Haunting.\u201d And the trouble is, I always have to back up that title by labeling it \u201cthe Robert Wise haunted-house film from the 1960s\u201d because I know that they\u2019re thinking of the other \u201cThe Haunting\u201d (the 1999 Jan De Bont remake of the 1963 film with Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones). I\u2019ll have something to say about the remake later and why it definitely doesn\u2019t work in comparison to its predecessor, but I truly love the original film. In fact, I love it so much to admit that it\u2019s just my favorite scary film\u2014it\u2019s one of my all-time favorite movies.\n\u201cThe Haunting\u201d is a superb, gorgeously-shot, very well thought-out chiller that uses psychological tension and character development in the same concepts of mystery and atmosphere. It takes place in a haunted house\u2014Hill House, to be exact\u2014and it\u2019s about a group of characters who would like to investigate the supernatural occurrences of such a place but get much more than they expected. That premise sounds pretty simple, but Wise\u2019s direction, along with great cinematography as well as great acting, makes it far more than what it could have been. Even if you don\u2019t really find it very scary (it depends on whether or not you accept the \u201cless is more\u201d aspect\u2014I\u2019ll explain later in this review), it\u2019s still a gripping psychological thriller, Gothic story, and character study.\n\u201cThe Haunting\u201d begins with an opening narration over a shot of an ominous-looking mansion in the night, and right away, the narration sets up the premise in a most interesting way. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard a depiction of a haunted house, or rather just exploring a haunted house, has ever been put in a better way. \u201cAn evil old house, the kind some people call haunted, is like an undiscovered country waiting to be explored. Hill House has stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more. Silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there\u2026walked alone.\u201d And when the intellectual voice of Richard Johnson puts it like that, I think I might follow him as well as those his character, Dr. John Markway, are brought into his experiment. And yes, his experiment is simply to investigate any sort of paranormal activity while spending several nights in Hill House. The house is full of history that connects to further evidence that it may be haunted, which fascinates him even more. He wants to know if everything he\u2019s heard and studied is as real as it may seem.\nBrought in on the project are Eleanor \u201cNell\u201d Lance (Julie Harris), clairvoyant Theodora \u201cTheo\u201d (Claire Bloom), and the house\u2019s cynical new heir, Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn). Eleanor, in particular, is our main focus of the film, as we hear her inner thoughts a good amount of time and has the most compelling character arc of the group. She\u2019s a meek, insecure, guilt-ridden woman who has spent most of her adult life caring for her sick mother until her death, leading to further severe guilt that she has to deal with everyday. She seeks to belong somewhere with somebody, which is why she does take a chance and leaves her sister\u2019s apartment (where she sleeps on the couch), and steals her sister\u2019s car to make her way to Hill House, where she is finally expected somewhere.\nHill House itself is a marvel to look at. It\u2019s a large, maze-like mansion that looks like a Gothic castle, with many secrets and unsettling decorations and such. Among the most notable unsettling locations in the house is the library, which features a tall, spiraling staircase that is very rickety and unsafe. The exteriors and interiors of Hill House are just extraordinary and the whole place gives off a creepy vibe. You definitely can tell that something is not quite right with this place. Eleanor notices this upon first arriving, thinking to herself that \u201cit\u2019s looking at me\u201d and if she goes into this house, she\u2019s afraid she won\u2019t come out the same way. But she does come inside, get to know Markway, Theo, and Luke, and surely enough, many strange things occur with apparent supernatural forces at work here.\nBut how much of the supernatural is actually \u201csupernatural?\u201d We spend so much time with Eleanor and we know that she isn\u2019t quite mentally-stable because of her insecurities that sometimes take her over, so you have to wonder just how much of this ghost-story is actual ghosts and how much of it is actually in Eleanor\u2019s mind. It\u2019s evident that ghosts are real in these surroundings, as Eleanor is not the only one to experience these happenings. But what about when she explores the house herself and feels herself to be more at home, in a way depicted creepier than it sounds? Is she being controlled by the paranormal forces, is she letting in to her hopes of belonging somewhere, are her insecurities getting the very best of her? I won\u2019t go into too much detail about what I get out of the connection between her and Hill House, but trust me when I say it\u2019s an excellent psychological study. And that this is a character who seeks redemption and acceptance within a haunted house makes it even more unnerving.\nIt\u2019s hard to pick my favorite \u201cscary moment,\u201d as most people choose their own favorite scary moments from their favorite horror films (the opening in \u201cHalloween,\u201d the exorcism in \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d the shower scene in \u201cPsycho,\u201d and so on). There are literally more than I could think of right off the bat, and oddly enough, every time I watch the movie again, I find myself unnerved throughout the whole movie because of those many moments. To name some of these scenes, I\u2019d start with the introduction in which we see in flashback (with help of Dr. Markway\u2019s narration) the past historic happenings of Hill House (suicide, accidents, etc.)\u2014it\u2019s a great opening and also very well-crafted in how it\u2019s able to set up the environment and build up suspense for the rest of the story, and of course quite unnerving. There\u2019s the first occurrence on the characters\u2019 first night in Hill House, as Eleanor and Theo are frightened by loud, pounding noises coming from outside their bedroom and hold onto one another in fear\u2014the terror is genuine and the scares come as unexpected so that the characters\u2019 fear becomes ours, because we know just about as much as they do. Most memorably, arguably, is the scene in which Eleanor awakens at night to hear what sounds like a child being beaten and crying in pain. She wants to yell but is too afraid to, and she holds hands with Theo who is obviously as frightened as she is because, as we hear through Eleanor\u2019s inner thoughts, she is holding on to her hand a little too tightly. When she finally yells \u201cSTOP IT!\u201d and the lights turn on, she looks to see that\u2026nobody was holding her hand the whole time. This is a perfect \u201cscary moment\u201d\u2014the buildup, the tension, and the payoff are all very well-handled, making the standard-but-needed question \u201cWhose hand was I holding\u201d seem all the more impactful. There are many more moments like that in this movie. And do I even need to mention that the aforementioned \u201ctall, spiraling staircase\u201d comes into place for a crucial moment later?\nThe casting of the four principal roles is spot-on. Julie Harris is excellent as Eleanor, creating a believable portrait of an odd, meek woman who is possibly misguided to find a place to feel accepted. It\u2019s a great performance and it makes \u201cThe Haunting\u201d more of a character study than a haunted-house story. Richard Johnson is also great as Dr. Markway, a man who could convince you to jump off a cliff if he found a solid reasoning behind it. I love the way he puts the supernatural occurrences most of us have heard of, particularly the difference between \u201cghosts\u201d and \u201cghouls.\u201d Claire Bloom makes Theo her own character and also gives a certain indication that she might actually be a lesbian, which could explain why she acts the way she does toward Eleanor (compassion mixed with teasing most of the time) and also would give another disturbing sense in the scenes when they\u2019re the only ones in a room together. Bloom makes risky decisions with this role, but they\u2019re never over-the-top and are played effectively. I even enjoyed Russ Tamblyn\u2019s comic relief\u2014as Luke, Tamblyn plays a man who doesn\u2019t believe in the supernatural or the phenomena; he\u2019s just protecting his investment after being left the house and simply enjoys poking fun at whatever experience or little detail that the other characters bring up. He\u2019s a smooth, wisecracking guy who likes to drink and crack jokes (\u201cThis ghost I can expect in my room tonight\u2014is it male or female?\u201d), which makes his ultimate belief in what\u2019s really happening here all the more effective because all this time, he has served as a representation for some of the more cynical audience members. When he finally seems as scared as everyone else, it\u2019s believable.\nThe filmmaking serves as another reason \u201cThe Haunting\u201d works as well as it does. A good number of shots in this movie looks like it\u2019s been fully prepared for first, so that we feel a hint of unease and also fascination. Even the reaction shots, which are mostly thankless, say something about the consistency\u2014some of them are even at low angles with characters on either the right or left side of the screen. With a location as grand as Hill House, it\u2019s important to know how to frame certain shots and Robert Wise obviously went out of his way to create something unique.\n\u201cThe Haunting\u201d is undoubtedly my favorite horror film. Its scares are more than effective because of how much its psychological terror works well. The themes are very well-presented. The depictions of the \u201chaunted\u201d aspects of this house and the occurrences are fascinating to listen to. The lead character of Eleanor is a great character for this sort of story. And it fascinates me and of course continues to scare me every time I watch it. It\u2019s a well-crafted, excellent chiller.\nNOTE: I mentioned the brilliant opening lines earlier in this review. I should also add that the similar-sounding ending lines are even more chilling, particularly because of who says them."}

{"doc_id": "312", "text": "Was there recriticality at Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Plant?\nCriticality is a state in which nuclear fission reaction is occurring continuously in nuclear fuel. Nuclear fission generates a large amount of radiation and thermal energy. By artificially generating and controlling critical condition, nuclear power plants create thermal energy to produce electric power.\nIn the course of the nuclear accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, nuclear fuels inside the reactors of Unit 1 to 3 melted down and the debris is scattered at the bottom or outside below the reactor pressure vessels. In the accident, intense heat of the molten fuel melted the vessels and the fuel fell through the holes. Molten fuel solidified as abundant water was poured in and has been cooled by flowing water ever since.\nIs there any possibility that this molten fuel (fuel debris) will become critical again?\nTo judge this, measurement of \u201cradioactive noble gas\u201d such as Xenon plays a big role.\nRadioactive noble gas is an important indicator of the presence of criticality for it is created in fission reaction.\nGas discharged from the containment vessel which covers the pressure vessel is closely monitored by the \u201cgas management system.\u201d The system analyses the kind and amount of each component in real time.\nShould there were any recriticality, radiation level of radioactive noble gases would increase indicating the presence of the state of criticality. The radioactivity level of radioactive noble gas at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant so far has been maintained at a very low level that is incomparable to what was observed in the critical state of the accident.\nIt has never increased as to show critical signs up until now. This signifies the nuclear fuel once melted in the accident is kept in stable condition (maintained in subcritical state).\nTemperature of the now-defunct nuclear reactor in which molten nuclear fuel is cooled is also measured in real time. It is about the same as the outside temperature or a little colder (around 15 to 30 degrees).\nThis means heat accompanying criticality is not only generated but also the amount of heat emitted by the decay of radioactive materials is very small.\nAs a safety measure, equipments to inject boric acid water to halt the chain reaction of nuclear fission are installed in case re-criticality occurs."}

Bain Capital and Advent International bought a majority stake.\nIn late 2013 they took full ownership, valuing the company at over \u00a32 billion.\nThis new ownership has lit a fire under the organisation who has now stepped up it\u2019s operation, with a new focus and a newly energised management team.\nBecause Worldpay operate on such a large scale it was important from the beginning to develop a core idea which would tell their whole story through their branding. Yes they process transactions and provide payment solutions, but what they really do is connect people. They enable buyers and sellers to interact with one another from anywhere in the world, seamlessly and with ease.\nAn exhaustive set of iconography enables the brand to transcend language across the 40+ countries they operate in.\nOf course, there\u2019s a new logo, inspired by the data trails made by money as they travel around the planet seamlessly.\nBrand work for the new London HQ, including new systems for navigating almost 100,000 square feet of offices in the Foster + Partners designed Wallbrook Building in the City of London.\nThe move to Wallbrook brings together five offices to one central state of the art London hub. We worked with the TSK group on the interior design to bring the brand world into the space without it becoming repetitive badging.\nThis is what the old Worldpay website looked like.\nWe worked for over a year to create a strategic approach to the newly invigorated brand analysing and redesigning hundreds of touch points. Everything from how the brand speaks to people, the imagery it uses, iconography it employs, to installations in the new and existing offices have been created by SomeOne.\nSomeOne elsewhere on Identity Designed: Wright Brothers, Big Eyes, Resonate.\nMore work on the SomeOne website.\nOverall very nice. I agree with Naill that the 2d logo is a tad bit awkward. I would bet at a smaller scale and in print it is looks quite elegant, but this large scale isn\u2019t doing it any favors.\nI think the tone and esthetic quality of the type and symbols is very appropriate. It reminds me of the animated videos\u2014which were keyed to Gershwin\u2019s Rhapsody in Blue\u2014that they would play preflight in United Airlines airplanes. I think that same grand, busy, and connected world tone is resonating here.\nWhile the loxodrome and wordmark are a big improvement on the previous design, I think there\u2019s a disconnect between the logo and the custom alphabet and icons.\nI find the logo to be a bit forgettable although the loxodrome is really well done, but the alphabet and icons are truly lovely. The write-up edges close to hyperbole in places, and I don\u2019t find the website to be particularly radical, but it is a finance company after all.\nHaving said that, the whole thing \u2013 website, packaging, stationery, etc \u2013 is lovely (mainly thanks to that gorgeous bespoke type)."}

This service is increasing in popularity across the globe. It makes it easier for students to handle their school requirements. But the nature of the service remains shrouded in controversy. After all, teachers and professors give out assignments for a reason. They are meant to boost the skills of students both inside and outside the classroom. This begs the question: Do assignment help services benefit or hurt students?\nIt\u2019s easy to see the benefits of hiring assignments experts to aid in your academic pursuits. They solve the problem of insufficient time to do homework\u2019s, especially if you take on multiple part-time jobs after school hours. As you know, writing essays or completing complicated assignments can take up a boatload of time. Between gathering information and adding the final touches, your assignment can take several hours to finish.\nThe speed with which you can finish your assignments with the help of service providers like the guys at Do My Assignments is another huge benefit. Most companies accept expedited requests for an extra fee. It\u2019s possible to get your paper or assignment in as little as 24 hours. While these aforementioned benefits are surely hard to resist, it\u2019s worth noting that using assignment writing services offers more than meets the eye.\nAt first, it might not appear to make sense that hiring assignment help providers can improve your research skills. You don\u2019t even need to research about anything. They will do everything for you, and this is where you can get tips from the experts.\nBy looking at the final output of the assignment expert, you could see how much it differs from the homework\u2019s you have done yourself. It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise if these differences are very noticeable. You could tell that time and effort has been dedicated to producing such a well-researched assignment. Even the references and links can help you with your future requirements, as you would see how much more credible your work will look like if the links aren\u2019t limited to Wikipedia.\nThe same applies to your presentation skills. The way the essay, research paper, or assignment is formatted can give you ideas on how to better structure your content. Notice how the ideas flow smoothly throughout, allowing you to get the point across even without the use of fancy words. You probably have a \u201cgo-to\u201d format for your essays, but you\u2019ll realize that it doesn\u2019t always work.\nIt\u2019s easy to dismiss assignment writing services as only for lazy students who do not care at all about learning. But it\u2019s important to understand that the students can enjoy much more than its time-saving benefits. With the help of experts, you can pick up some tips on how to research about a topic, what credible sources to use, and how to present your ideas in a way that engages readers. All of these can prove beneficial for any student, even the ones who do remarkably well in class."}

{"doc_id": "331", "text": "Stefano Guzetti is a composer, producer and sound designer based in Sardina, Italy. He has an ensemble that has released three albums, Home Piano Book (Volume One), Ensemble, and Leaf. He was previously an ambient electronic musician as Waves on Canvas. While not touring Stefano produces soundtracks and sound design for film, documentaries and video games.\nInnerversitysound: Stefano, a bit of background first. You had a recent earlier electronic outfit called Waves on Canvas that produced electronic music that was received well enough given the scene. But nothing in comparison to the reception that your three albums with your ensemble. Can you tell us a bit about the departure from electronic music to a form of modern classical ensemble? What was the impetus for you for this break?\nStefano: Basically I had a graduation in electronic music from the conservatory in my town. I was very into electronic music and I had studied it a lot. But also from childhood I had a background in classical music because I studied organ, or an instrument with a keyboard. Then I made this Waves on Canvas project and it was very great for me and also it was a way of mine to give a rendition, or a proper tribute to what I was into when I was younger, especially 4AD stuff in the Ivo (Watts-Russell) era. But in regarding electronic music I\u2019ve got this mixed feeling. Especially nowadays when everyone can buy a computer, a laptop and record some seagulls or birds with their smartphone and then download a version of Ableton Live, add some effects, some tweaks and then claim himself an electronic musician or a drone music musician.\nOne of the reasons for the change was I wanted to take a distance from all of this because now a lot of people, a lot really, are making electronic music. If you take an example of the 90\u2019s when buying music gear was really expensive and it wasn\u2019t something that was ready at hand for everyone, which wasn\u2019t a good thing anyway, because in my opinion everyone should have the opportunity to say something musically. It was different, now everyone is making electronic music and to my personal subjective perception most of them sound the same. Because they are done with the same environment, the same software, a laptop and so forth. This was one of the reasons but I also just wanted to get back to simple things and try to say something musically, just for me. Interested in just a few things, natural acoustic sounds for instance, and I wanted to get back to my roots, because when I was younger I was just playing an instrument as well. So this is something that really made me decide to be just me, myself, and just work with simple natural sounds. From time to time I had some electronicia, some simple sine waves and simple elements, like little noises, but these are just things that in electronic music are considered a simple thing, a sine wave. These are things you can also find in the works of Stockhausen or Xenakis, basically in the pioneers of electronic music. So we are not talking about synthesisers or computers but more about tapes. So I just decided to change and I\u2019m ok with this decision really.\nInnerversitysound:In interviews you have mentioned a wide range of influences from industrial, indie pop, German electronic music, drum and bass, ambient, and the ethereal electronic pop of your teenage years. The early band of yours Antennah, what was the ideas that drove you and your friend Valentinno Murru?\nStefano: When I was a child I was playing the organ and when I was a teenager I discovered New Wave bands, Joy Division and that kind of stuff from about 1986. So my decision was to buy a bass, I was a bass player and we just formed this band. We just wanted to make something new, quite na\u00efve. It was great but after about five years I just wanted to make something else and this electronic music thing in me started when I was very young I had this computer in my house and I started programming this computer to make simple sounds and to play by pressing the keys of the keyboard while I was playing the organ. So I was tweaking a home computer to make some sounds and noises and this was my very first approach to electronic music. So after I was in a band for five years, playing the bass, I felt a real need, an urgency to widen my palette of sounds so I decided to leave them and start making electronic music. From 1992 until 2006 I was making electronic music.\nThe last thing I did, apart from the Waves on Canvas project was a collection of remixes for Kirsten Hersch, the singer for Throwing Muses, because in a period around 2006-7 she was recording the tracks of her new album and releasing the tracks of the songs on the web. So I was just taking the vocal parts and doing the rest, a brand new arrangement with new chords, new tonal centre. Just then I was just starting to think differently about electronic music. So this is just my background, I was taught classical music, I played bass in a band but in the meantime I was still tweaking my computer at home, I embraced electronic music, but now it is like being back home again. Just being what I was when I started making music when I was a child.\nInnerversitysound: So the immediate reception of At Home Piano Book (Volume One) on Home Normal was decisive in its endorsement of your new approach to music. Can you tell us a bit about this album and how the collaboration with Ian Hawgood came about?\nStefano: Basically I started making these little compositions on the piano, they were just little ideas. I sat at the piano when I had ideas and if I felt they were interesting I just recorded the scratch idea on the iPad. So then I started to compose them properly with a kind of structure and my idea was to make a collection of piano impressions, like little water colours, something like that. Nothing too serious. I sent a few of those tracks to Ian, about 5 years back and he was really into those tracks. Then we started emailing and I felt quite lucky, because when you have a label like Home Normal, which is kind of busy, there are a lot of people sending stuff, I felt lucky anyway. And then we became friends. Of course there is a mutual friendship now between the artist and the label as well. I wanted to keep that feeling of playing in a room, a very simple thing.\nInnerversitysound: You are incorporating minimal electronic touches and processing. Has it receded so far into the background that it may eventually disappear? Or has the impression of the knowledge gained by exposure to these forms indelibly informed your composition of classic forms?\nStefano: There is a future release that will be out in September that is based on a work of a friend of mine who makes paintings and cartoons as well. He was living in Japan for about 9 years, he worked with Sakamoto, designed a Swatch and he made this last book about his memories in Japan. I was really inspired by his latest work because I love Japanese culture as well and then I wrote and produced this new album called Japanese Notebooks. It features some electronicia, but very subtle, there is also some in Leaf. It is just a little colour and nothing that characterises too much the overall sound. What I still like about elements that come from electronic are the sub-basses and that round warm feeling. And that is just from a simple sine wave, a regular oscillation of a wave. Yes there is still electronic music but very few and just in a very delicate measure. I am planning to use some electronic elements like arpeggios of simple waves to be a part of an arrangement in the future. I am thinking about this idea but mostly it is just acoustic music. I don\u2019t want to be a second hand Max Richter or things like that because mostly I am still exploring and looking for a language of mine of course for otherwise it would not be very useful to be out there and be a clone of someone.\nInnerversitysound: You formed an ensemble which is a change from the solitary electronic musician. It involves a good deal more interpersonal communication. How did forming this ensemble come about and can you tell us a bit about the dynamics of working with 3 other people in an ensemble has changed your practice?\nStefano: If you make electronic music for instance, you have a very immediate response to what you are doing because you are just playing sounds with a machine. You have got those sounds, just suddenly. When you score, when you write music on a score, yes you can make sounds to make a sort of pre-production of what you have in mind. But then again when you play with real players it will sound different again. So it\u2019s really exciting and interesting because a player is not a machine and he will play differently every time and it will depend on how tired he is from his feeling of the day; a lot of variations can happen and anyway real instruments forever change. Yes the real feeling is in the score but the overall feeling of the track can change of course. This is something that fascinates me a lot because we are humans, we are faulty humans by nature so it\u2019s great to transpose this aspect into music. We are not talking about recorded music that will sound the same every time you play it to your friends but music that will change every time and it\u2019s great. I love this, I really need this aspect from music to be alive, in a way.\nInnerversitysound: In Quiet Fracture on the Leaf album is the most sound designed piece of the recent few albums. Is this interlude kind of thing going to happen more often or was it something that just occurred in the making of the album.\nStefano: Yes, Leaf, it\u2019s an album of that started when my father started being ill. And my father now has a very serious illness. And this illness was showing by some very strange events like from time to time he was falling but we underestimated what was happening. Quiet Fracture is about something that is very slowly starts to go, in this case it was my father, and then shows in itself completely. So there are some steps and some laughter from a few women. This is quite symbolistic about something that starts to show inside and then grows as a big laughter. Yes that album it is written, \u2018from my father, to my father\u2019 and it was a very bad time and for some reasons it still is. It\u2019s quite personal to be honest.\nInnerversitysound: In reading background material about what you do I stopped at you commenting that you had adopted a very simple attitude towards life and music generally. If you could elaborate on this turn to simplicity and its effects on the whole of what you do in life.\nStefano: Simplicity, simple things, it is a value that I make mine a lot. For instance my decision to move on from electronic music to apparently more simple music. Like the title Leaf, it is just a small green element that we see on the side of the road, in the trees, but if you move your attention to the inner structure of the leaf, in this structure you see a lot of little path roads and this is a clear symptom that simplicity shows us a different world if you take the right pathways and if you approach simplicity with the right attitude. I have been doing Zen meditation for about 10 years in my life so I am really attached to a simple approach to life which is not a basic approach. It is just simple because then by embracing simplicity you can embrace the complexity of life as well. So it is something very connected. Like for instance when I was making electronic music I had complexity at hand very easy because of sounds, because of all those electronic elaborations on sounds as well. But to me it wasn\u2019t that interesting anymore. But if you use just simple sounds and you give them the proper attention to the inner structure of a simple acoustic sound, it has a lot of things that change every time. Like if you struck a note on the piano and every time it will resonate differently and this is apparently a simple sound which it definitely is not. This is an example of simplicity not being simple at all. Simplicity being a great and a good example of the complexity of life itself. Because simple things to me are just the first side of the real complexity of life.\nInnerversitysound: Your album Japanese Notebooks is slated for later this year. Is it completed yet, or is it still in production or in Ian Hawgood\u2019s very long cue for mastering?\nStefano: The album is just finished, mixed and mastered. I finished it in January and I am leaving it to \u2018take the dust\u2019 for 4 to 5 months and then I will listen to it again to fix a few things with fresh ears and a fresh mind because you have to take the distance from things at a certain point. Possibly, I don\u2019t know yet, I will ask someone to master it. I still have to decide. I usually master things myself, I am very much of a DIY person, and I really love this attitude. I do almost everything about my job; like promoting, producing, I have my own label as well, Stella Recordings, for my stuff, so it\u2019s really important for me to have most of the things under my control. I rarely work with people, one of these ones is Ian because I really trust him, we are friends, but I really trust Ian and his approach to music. So this album is basically finished, I just have to fix a few things here and there. But that\u2019s it really.\nInnerversitysound: In terms of ambitions, or strategies when this simplicity gets a bit tricky and demanding. Have you an escape plan lined up?\nStefano: My escape plan is that I will always have to be honest with myself and correct about what I am doing at the moment. And when all of this won\u2019t work anymore I will ask myself what is happening and if I won\u2019t have any reply for myself, I always tell myself and to my future wife as well, maybe I will stop making music as well. I hate the idea of riding the wave of what is going on at the moment because I wouldn\u2019t be honest to myself and mostly I would be wasting my time. Because it is not written anywhere in the sky that I have to make music. Maybe there will be a time when I just have to stop, or maybe not. I don\u2019 know. But what I know is that my only escape is just to be honest with myself and ask myself directly what\u2019s happening and add a proper reply, never be negative or positive. I hope positive.\nLeaf is out now on Stella Recordings and digitally on Home Normal."}

{"doc_id": "337", "text": "Becoming a professional coach is one of the most rewarding jobs I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s such an honor to be able to help people grow in their personal leadership skills and pursue their true purpose and passions to make a huge impact in the world. I love facilitating \u201ca-ha moments\u201d for people and guiding them towards success. I never thought I would become a coach because I didn\u2019t even know that the coaching industry existed until about 3 years ago. Since then, I learned more about it, volunteered and practiced it as much as I could, and took steps to call this my career. Today, I wanted to answer some FAQs for people who are interested in becoming a coach or adding coaching skills to their repertoire. As you read this, imagine us chatting together at a coffee shop with the freedom for you to pick my brain. My hope is that this gives you more insight to the industry and provides a little bit of direction of your next steps.\nQ: I love helping people. I\u2019ve always enjoyed mentoring and guiding younger people. Is coaching right for me? A: Yes! The heart of coaching is helping people to figure out what they want, why they want it, and provide the support and accountability for them to be successful. When you get down to it, a coach sees someone for their potential and equips them with the skills and resources for them to be the best version of themselves. A coach is someone who wants to facilitate change, growth, and get people from where they are now to where they want to be. It\u2019s definitely considered to be a \u201chelping profession.\u201d It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be with someone younger than you, but people tend to work with coaches that they can relate to. The question to ask yourself is, \u201cWHY do you want to become a coach?\u201d Get clear on your definition of success. If it\u2019s genuinely to help people get better in a motivating way, then coaching may be a good fit for you.\nQ: What are my options as a coach? // What can I do as a coach? A: There are many paths you can take, or make yourself! Typically you could: be to go-to coach for your current company, be a coach that consults for other companies, or start your own private coaching business/practice. There are many different niches as well: including health/wellness, business, life, executive, leadership and success, and career. Or, you could get coach training for basic coach skills (communication, listening, asking questions, goal-setting/accountability) that could equip you to be a better leader in your current job.\nQ: How can I get started with coaching? A: Start Where You Are! First, if you\u2019ve never experienced working with a coach yourself, I highly encouraged you to do it. That way, you know first-hand what it\u2019s all about. You can go to local workshops and seminars hosted by a coach, or invest in working with one yourself. Then, the best way to see if coaching is right for you as a career is to engage in opportunities to learn and practice coaching. Find people and opportunities where you can offer your listening ear and expertise. If you're working 9-5, what are some ways you can add value to your company by helping others grow? For example, it could be a book club, speaking in a professional development series, or creating an accountability group. The key is to find practical ways to practice (even if it\u2019s on your friends!) Think of it as an experiment: Who do I love to help? What kind of problems are they dealing with? What value am I providing them? Do I even like this?\nSomething you can try to practice with people one-on-one: create a survey asking questions about people\u2019s needs and desires, send it out to friends and people in your network, and offer a mini-coaching session to those who have filled it out. This gives you a better idea of what people need and are looking for, and also real-world experience in coaching people.\nQ: Do I need training or certification? A: Getting training is like the difference between between street smart and and school smart. You may naturally have great coaching skills, but training hones them to take to the next level. I like to think of it like the difference between a street basketball player and a professional one. A street basketball player is naturally skilled and may have fun playing the game, but when you\u2019re ready to go pro, training helps provide structure and expertise, and confidence in helping you know what you\u2019re doing. Coach training is an investment and can range from $500-$2000 per module (and even up to $10,000 for the whole shebang), so carefully consider it before going all in. I went to Erickson International, and have heard good things about Co-Active Coach Training, and Lifeforming.\nCertification is getting officially registered by the International Coach Federation. You need to have at coach training and at least 100 hours in order to apply. It\u2019s a great route to consider if you value professional development, and a must-have if you want to work for corporate companies for executive/leadership coaching. A lot of corporate companies will only hire coaches with those credentials. But if you worked with clients one-on-one in your own private practice, it\u2019s not necessary. Keep in mind that clients buy for results. As long as you provide value and results, clients will be happy to work with you.\nBuilding a business takes a lot of time and persistence. It\u2019s one thing to be a great coach but it\u2019s another thing to be a great business owner. It takes a lot of focused intention and attention, and it doesn\u2019t happen overnight. I always say that building a business is the BEST personal development because you\u2019re always learning new things (that constantly keep changing) and pushing yourself to grow.\nPeople don\u2019t buy coaching, they buy results. This is a marketing thing. To more clear you are about who you help and how you help them, they better chance you\u2019ll find the people you\u2019re meant to serve and get paying clients. I naively thought that saying \u201cI can coach!\u201d would attract people to me. Instead, I had to learn some savvy marketing skills and get clear on my audience, message, and services.\nThings are constantly changing. Things within the industry are constantly changing. The coach I was one year ago is way different than the coach I am today (for the better!) Business is the same way. Things that worked before may not worked now. So I\u2019m constantly experimenting with new marketing channels and offerings. I like the challenge of trying new things, but I\u2019m also balancing it with trying to remain consistent in things like my voice and helpful habits.\nInvest in things that matter. Some people may think the only expenses needed for an online coaching business is a laptop, internet, and a phone (which you already have). But realistically, start-up costs could be education, training, web site/marketing materials/branding, office supplies, legal fees, etc. Those things add up. It\u2019s good to have a budget to set aside money to invest in things to matter to you. For me, that was education, branding, and working with a coach.\nQ: What are your favorite books/resources? A: I love reading! Here\u2019s a list of my recommended books for leadership, business, and creativity. I continue to add to the list, so let me know what your recommendations are!\nI hope this Q+A session helped you get a better peek into our world and give you clarity for the direction of your coach journey. My vision is that someday coaching will become more mainstreamed and that everyone would be equipped with basic coaching skills. Wouldn\u2019t that be AWESOME?!\nLeave your comments or questions below and SHARE the love on your favorite social media channels!"}
{"doc_id": "338", "text": "Residential buildings account for a significant amount of the national energy consumption of all OECD countries and consequently the EU and the Netherlands. Therefore, the national targets for CO2 reduction should include provisions for a more energy efficient building stock for all EU member states.\nNational and European level policies the past decades have improved the quality of the building stock by setting stricter standards on the external envelope of newly made buildings, the efficiency of the mechanical and heating components, the renovation practices and by establishing an energy labelling system. Energy related occupancy behavior is a significant part, and relatively unchartered, of buildings\u2019 energy consumption. This thesis tried to contribute to the understanding of the role of the occupant related to the energy consumption of residential buildings by means of simulations and experimental data obtained by an extensive measurement campaign.\nThe first part of this thesis was based on dynamic building simulations in combination with a Monte Carlo statistical analysis, which tried to shed light to the most influential parameters, including occupancy related ones, that affect the energy consumption and comfort (a factor that is believed to be integral to the energy related behavior of people in buildings). The reference building that was used for the simulations was the TU Delft Concept House that was built for the purposes of the European project SusLab NWE. The concept house was simulated as an A energy label (very efficient) and F label (very inefficient) dwelling and with three different heating systems.\nThe analysis revealed that if behavioral parameters are not taken into account, the most critical parameters affecting heating consumption are the window U value, window g value, and wall conductivity. When the uncertainty of these parameters increases, the impact of the wall conductivity on heating consumption increases considerably. The most important finding was that when behavioral parameters like thermostat use and ventilation flow rate are added to the analysis, they dwarf the importance of the building parameters in relation to the energy consumption. For the thermal comfort (the PMV index was used as the established model for measuring indoor thermal comfort) the most influential parameters were found to be metabolic activity and clothing, while the thermostat had a secondary impact.\nThe simulations were followed by an extensive measurement campaign where an in-situ, non-intrusive, wireless sensor system was installed in 32, social housing, residential dwellings in the area of Den Haag. This sensor system was transmitting quantitative data such as temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, and motion every five minutes for a period of six months (the heating period between November to April) and from every room of the 32 dwellings that participated in the campaign. Furthermore, subjective data were gathered during an initial inspection during the installation of the sensor system, concerning the building envelope, the heating and ventilation systems of the dwellings. More importantly though, subjective data were gathered related to the indoor comfort of the occupants with the use of an apparatus that was developed specifically for the SusLab project. This gimmick, named the comfort dial, allowed us to capture data such as the occupants\u2019 comfort level in the PMV 7 point scale. In addition further comfort related data like the occupants\u2019 clothing ensemble, actions related to thermal comfort, and their metabolic activity were captured with the use of a diary. The subjective data measurement session lasted for a week for each dwelling. These data were time coupled real time with the quantitative data that were gathered by the sensor system.\nThe data analysis focused on the two available indoor thermal comfort models, Fanger\u2019s PMV index and the adaptive model. Concerning the PMV model the analysis showed that while the neutral temperatures are well predicted by the PMV method, the cold and warm sensations are not. It appears that tenants reported (on a statistically significant way) comfortable sensations while the PMV method does not predict such comfort. This indicates a certain level of psychological adaptation to occupant\u2019s expectations. Additionally it was found that although clothing and metabolic activities were similar among tenants of houses with different thermal quality, the neutral temperature was different. Specifically in houses with a good energy rating, the neutral temperature was higher than in houses with a poor rating.\nConcerning the adaptive model, which was developed as the answer to the discrepancies of Fanger\u2019s model related to naturally ventilated buildings (the majority of the residential sector), data analysis showed that while indoor temperatures are within the adaptive model\u2019s comfort bandwidth, occupants often reported comfort sensations other than neutral. In addition, when indoor temperatures were below the comfort bandwidth, tenants often reported that they felt \u2018neutral\u2019. The adaptive model could overestimate as well as underestimate the occupant\u2019s adaptive capacity towards thermal comfort. Despite the significant outdoors temperature variation, the indoor temperature of the dwellings, as well as the clothing of the tenants, were largely constant. Certain actions towards thermal comfort such as \u2018turning the thermostat up\u2019 were taking place while tenants were reporting thermal sensation \u2018neutral\u2019 or \u2018a bit warm\u2019. This indicates that either there is an indiscrimination among the various thermal sensation levels or alliesthesia, a new concept introduced by the creators of the adaptive model, plays an increased role. Most importantly there was an uncertainty on whether the neutral sensation means at the same time comfortable sensation while many actions are happening out of habit and not in order to improve one\u2019s thermal comfort. A chi\u00b2 analysis showed that only six actions were correlated to thermal sensation in thermally poorly efficient dwellings, and six in thermally efficient dwellings.\nFinally, the abundance of data collected during the measurement campaign led the last piece of research of this thesis to data mining and pattern recognition analysis. Since the introduction of computers, the way research is performed has changed significantly. Huge amounts of data can be gathered and handled by evermore faster computers; the analysis of these data a couple of decades ago would take years.\nSequential pattern mining reveals frequently occurring patterns from time-ordered input streams of data. A great deal of nature behaves in a periodic manner and these strong periodic elements of our environment have led people to adopt periodic behavior in many aspects of their lives such as the time they wake up in the morning, the daily working hours, the weekend days off, the weekly sports practice. These periodic interactions could extend in various aspects of our lives including the relationship of people with their home thermal environment. Repetitive behavioural actions in sensor rich environments, such as the dwellings of the measurement campaign, can be observed and categorized into patterns. These discoveries could form the basis of a model of tenant behaviour that could lead to a self-learning automation strategy or better occupancy data to be used for better predictions of building simulating software such as Energy+ or ESP-r and others.\nThe analysis revealed various patterns of behaviour; indicatively 59% of the dwellings during the morning hours (7-9 a.m.) were increasing their indoor temperature from 20 oC< T< 22 oC to T> 22oC or that the tenants of 56% of the dwellings were finding the temperature 20 oC< T< 22 oC to be a bit cool and even for temperatures above 22 oC they were having a warm shower leading to the suspicion that a warm shower is a routine action not related to thermal comfort.\nSuch pattern recognition algorithms can be more effective in the era of mobile internet, which allows the capturing of huge amounts of data. Increased computational power can analyse these data and define useful patterns of behaviour that could be tailor made for each dwelling, for each room of a dwelling, even for each individual of a dwelling. The occupants could then have an overview of their most common behavioural patterns, see which ones are energy consuming, which ones are related to comfort and which are redundant, and therefore, could be discarded leading to energy savings. In any case the balance between indoor comfort and energy consumption will be the final factor that would lead the occupant to decide on a customised model of his indoor environment.\nThe general conclusion of this thesis is that the effect of energy related occupancy behaviour on the energy consumption of dwellings should not be statistically defined for large groups of population. There are so many different types of people inhabiting so many different types of dwellings that embarking in such a task would be a considerable waste of time and resources.\nThe future in understanding the energy related occupancy behaviour, and therefore using it towards a more sustainable built environment, lies in the advances of sensor technology, big data gathering, and machine learning. Technology will enable us to move from big population models to tailor made solutions designed for each individual occupant."}

{"doc_id": "342", "text": "Over last weekend while I was reading the newspaper, I came across an article by Janice Tay, a freelance writer, who was studying in a Japanese language school in Kyoto. It was time for her and her classmates to graduate and time for them to bid Sayoranara to each other. They had been in Kyoto for a year and a half and some of them had grown so attach to each other that it was hard for some of them to say goodbye. I believe that most of us would be able to relate to what they felt as we had already gone through similar experience in our lives.\nThey were having a farewell party at the pub and everyone was drinking and catching up for the last time before going their separate way. It had gone to a point whereby some were getting emotional and were weeping. In that moment, someone said, \u201cDon\u2019t cry \u2013 everyone will be friends forever.\u201d Yes. That is true to certain extent and only for a few. I particularly agree with the author\u2019s point of view that \u2018keeping in touch with someone you can\u2019t see and hear takes energy and imagination that few have.\u2018 If you and the person you are keeping in touch with believe in this. There will be a good chance to be friends forever. Otherwise, one will find it challenging even to find time to send an email. Friends forever \u2013 it is possible when both sides make time and effort plus a right portion of expectation. In fact, what is being said here can be applied to most relationships. In order to make a relationship work, it takes a good amount of communication but you will need to find time and to put in the effort to communicate in the first place.\nWell, the key thing in the article that caught my attention was not how to be friends forever but rather in a statement that Janice wrote \u2018You can\u2019t take today with you.\u2018 What immediately came across my mind when I was reading it is that the statement makes a lot of positive sense. It reminds me of a quotation by Helen Keller.\nHow often have you come across someone who told you that he/she had just broken up? Most initial response will be, \u201cYou will find someone new.\u201d And isn\u2019t that true for most people \u2026 eventually? The ones that never found someone new, most probably they never allowed themselves to start looking again after they went through the unhappy relationship.\nFor one who believes that thing always happened for a reason, one will not have any challenges of moving on. You may ask me, \u201cFor what reason it happened?\u201d What I can say is that we may not always see the reason immediately when it happened but when we do, it will be like \u201cAhem, so that\u2019s why!\u201d And sometimes we may not even realise the reason.\nWe can\u2019t take today with us \u2026 so we have to continue to move forward with the faith that tomorrow will be better and a lot of times, it really depends on ourselves to make tomorrow better. I wish goodness in everyday of your life and that you will have the courage to move forward fearlessly.\nWell said. Why do we only think about the good ol\u2019 memories when a relationship end?\nShouldn\u2019t we be dwelling on the parts that hurt the most in it which brings us to the ending?\nHuman minds are strange in selecting only the good things to remember at the wrong time.\nWell BK, I must say that you must be really inspired these days to come up with such a moving journal.\nAnyway,I definitely agree that one should let go of the past, especially the ones that brought them excruciating experience (pain). However, the lesson it brought that person should be kept forever, thus giving him/her the opportunity to use them as he /she goes forward in his/her life.\nNo matter how painful a situation can be, at the end of the road, a ray of light is waiting to be caught. So, always look at the brighter side of every situation!\nIt\u2019s the art of letting go. Very nice article. I will dig it.\nThe answer was \u2018No\u2019 naturally. Exactly! In order for you to put another glass of water at the same corner, the first glass of water must be removed. The same applies. I agree with you totally that lessons must be learnt from the past experience.\nVery true. It is not always easy to live in the now. One is constantly thinking of yesterday or tomorrow. When only TODAY counts. Like your blog.\nyour attitude and choices of the past.\nthe choices you make today!\nThat will make a difference tomorrow!\nHi Nihal, you are definitely right, we have \u201conly one life chance\u201d to live.\nI love this post. It\u2019s just so true.\nI especially liked your question about how you would play the game if you knew that by putting in 100% you would win.\nYour attitude can truly make you or break you.\nJane @ Kidzaramas last blog post..Do You Get Dressed Up To Go Out?\nExcellent post BK\u2026you only get one today\u2026so making the most of it & watching out for those \u201copen doors\u201d makes all the difference \ud83d\ude42 Hanging onto things that can\u2019t be saved doesn\u2019t do much good for anyone.\n@ Shawie, the art of detachment is truly a challenge to learn and yet it gives us freedom.\n@ Chelle, you are right; hanging onto things that can\u2019t be saved doesn\u2019t do much good for anyone and yet it is such a challenge for a lot of people to learn to let go and move on; Just as water left a trail wherever it passed.\nTinas last blog post..HOW DO YOU THINK MAN WAS MADE?\nvery well written and totally agree with you.\nOne chance, truly. Great writing.\nStefans last blog post..Is the lifestyle in America too convenient?\nI had to swallow real big on this one. What a beautiful post. wow\u2026for me, I just need to read this over and over and over again. I guess that is what time is for.\nThank you for such a truly heartfelt post.\n@ Cricket, when I first read the article, I felt a big knock on my head and the bell seemed to be ringing. Some may call it enlightenment. However, it makes so much sense to me that the thought starts to flow in my mind and eventually this article. Thank you for enjoying this post and hope that you might help you in ways it did for me.\nwow BK! you\u2019re so inspired huh!\nit\u2019s so true about relationships. i\u2019ve tried communicating again with old friends with the hope of reviving old friendships, but it seems some are leading and living different lives. but there are few who are still the same old friends i\u2019ve known even without constant communication.\n@ Cricket, glad that it did. Have a great weekend!\nThat was a great post \u2013 really enjoyed the reminder!\ndang! i am so stupid! im sorry bk, i thought you were a lady. \ud83d\ude41 i hope you\u2019ll forgive me.\n@ Fashion Forward, it is simple truth and yet very challenging in action. Very often people are unwilling to let it go. Letting go is something we all need to do. It will take practice.\nI\u2019ve moved a lot in my adult life. And I\u2019ve asked myself those same kinds of questions. Is there really a point to keeping up with someone that you can\u2019t see or spend time with. I\u2019ve definitely come to the conclusion that when one door seems like it\u2019s closing, trying to hold it open is the wrong way to go.\n@ Ben, much as we must not be ever ready to give up without a fight, we must know when to let go when holding on is doing more harm to us. The challenge is always knowing when to fight and when to let go.\n.-= rainboy\u00b4s last blog ..Happy Birthday \ud83d\ude00 =-.\nI guess it is alright to be caught up in the moment and wail about being apart and all, for it is the only way to really show that our friends really matter and have been a big part of our lives.

{"doc_id": "344", "text": "Last summer I took a cross-country road trip with a group of people driving different types of electric vehicles.\nIt was an amazing experience, and our trip, our adventures, and our misadventures were portrayed in the documentary Kick Gas.\nThat experience gave me the idea to take my own road trip to experience the freedom of traveling alone on an electric motorcycle.\nMy goals were simple: ride the great motorcycle roads of America, meet other electric motorcycle riders, and visit friends.\nThe cross-country trip last summer taught me that charging stations are plentiful near cities, but sparse near the good roads. By \"good roads\" I mean the mountainous, twisty, curvy, windy, fun roads you dream about when buying a motorcycle!\nTo take road trips in an electric vehicle as easily as in a gas-powered vehicle, two things are necessary: a car with a highway range of 150-plus miles, plus DC fast charging available every 50 miles. That would be a good beginning as we await an affordable 1,000-mile battery.\nCurrently drivers must rely on the availability of public and private charging stations to venture further than half the range of their electric vehicle. This creates a bit of an adventure if you want to take a journey of, say, 4,000 miles.\nPublic charging stations are easiest to access. On the East Coast, you can show up at a charging station and pretty much expect that nobody else will be plugged in.\nThat's not the case in California, which has a much higher density of electric vehicles--at least some of them already using the charging station you've just arrived at.\nMy favorite public charging stations are at restaurants, so I have a place to eat and relax while my vehicle is charging. On this trip, I stopped at several Cracker Barrel restaurants in Tennessee and a Makuto's Japanese restaurant in Boone, North Carolina.\nCar dealerships will let motorcycles charge, although not always electric cars of another make. Nissan in particular has outfitted their dealerships with 240-Volt Lvel 2 chargers, and more recently, some of them now have high-powered CHAdeMO DC fast chargers.\nEven dealerships that normally only allow charging by cars sold by that dealer will allow me to plug in my electric motorcycle, since it's unique. Some dealers happily let me charge, others let me charge after a little conversation.\nStill, recharging my electric bike at a car dealer proved less than ideal, since they're often far from food or anywhere interesting to hang out.\nPersonal homes are fun if you plan ahead. I've met some interesting folks who make their home Level 2 charging stations available to travelers by listing them on the PlugShare app. They are lovely people, and meeting them is a fun part of being an early adopter.\nClearly, though, using someone's home charging station is not a sustainable way to propel electric vehicles forward.\nThe fun riding part of my journey began in Front Royal, Virginia, on Skyline Drive going through the Shenandoah Mountains. The road winds its way around the mountaintops and was designed as a sightseeing project by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nAfter a great day on Skyline Drive, I got to ride through the back woods around Blacksburg, Virginia, until I reached the glorious Blue Ridge Parkway. The road is absolutely incredible, flowing through farmland and mountains on either side for miles and miles.\nI made a brief stop in Asheville to swing -dance to bluegrass music with friends from Italy; I rode to the top of Mt. Mitchell, and then I headed to the best motorcycle road in America, known as the Dragon.\nAfter riding the Dragon, I headed to Nashville to visit some electric-motorcycle friends, and we headed down the famous Natchez Trace Parkway. This is another phenomenally beautiful road with scenic stops and meandering curves that caress the local terrain.\nThe first half of my journey ended in St. Louis, where I attended my cousin's wedding and visited the Country Music Hall of Fame. My trip was broken up because I had to fly back to New York City for a week, but I'll resume today--traveling to Chicago, Cleveland, and Rochester, New York, on my way to ride up New Hampshire's Mount Washington.\n1) It's still an adventure to take an electric-vehicle road trip (unless you're driving a Tesla using the company's Supercharger network).\n2) While it's easy to find charging stations, they're not always guaranteed to be available. They could be in use already, not working at all, or--worst of all--they might be \"ICEd,\" or blocked by a thoughtless driver of an internal-combustion engine (ICE) car.\n3) Most people at RV campgrounds are super-nice! I've shown up to many campgrounds unannounced, and most were incredibly welcoming and let me recharge my motorcycle for free (even though I always offer to pay the dollar or so for the electricity).\n4) To take a road trip in any electric vehicle, you need to plan ahead. At the start of each day, I decided where my stops for charging would be--including alternate locations if available.\n6) A couple of RV parks have claimed that they needed to replace receptacles to their 50-Amp hookup after a Tesla used it. This should be further investigated, as electric-vehicle owners very much don't want to burn those bridges or create any distrust of our community on the part of park owners.\n7) When I learn a Tesla has stopped at an RV park, the park operators will often ask me for $10 or more to recharge (my bike uses maybe $0.60 of electricity). This highlights the fact that most people have no idea how much electricity costs--and no one understands how much electricity different electric vehicles use. My motorcycle battery holds one-tenth the energy of a Tesla battery, so the cost for electricity is a factor of 10 less--but I often have to explain that slowly and carefully."}

{"doc_id": "356", "text": "Mark Frigon is a senior product manager with IBM\u2019s Enterprise Marketing Management organization, a key group involved in leading IBM\u2019s Smarter Commerce initiative. Mark\u2019s specialties are in Web analytics (he joined IBM as part of its acquisition of Coremetrics) and Internet privacy, an issue that has come to the forefront in recent years for digital marketers around the globe.\nEffective Web metrics are critical to the success of businesses looking to succeed in e-commerce and digital marketing these days, and IBM has a number of experts who spend a lot of their time in this area.\nOne of those here in Madrid at the IBM Smarter Commerce Global Summit, Mark Frigon, is a senior product manager for Web analytics in IBM\u2019s Enterprise Marketing Management organization.\nMark sat down with me to discuss the changing nature of Web analytics, and how dramatically it has evolved as a discipline over the past few years, including the increased focus by marketers on \u201cattribution,\u201d the ability to directly correlate a Web marketing action and the desired result.\nMark also spoke at the event about the importance for digital marketers around the globe to be more privacy-aware, a topic we also discussed in our time together, calling out in particular the \u201cDo-Not-Track\u201d industry self-regulatory effort that intends to put privacy controls in the hands of consumers.\nIf you spend any time thinking about Internet privacy or Web analytics, or both, this is a conversation you won\u2019t want to miss.\nRemember that team of blackjack-playing cohorts from MIT in the book (and, later, movie) \u201cBringing Down The House,\u201d who fleeced a number of Vegas casinos before they were invited never to grace their gambling doors again?\nIBM\u2019s Yuchun Lee explains to the IBM Smarter Commerce audience in Madrid how the company is doubling down on its investments in enterprise and social marketing management.\nWell, IBM executive and Unica co-founder Yuchung Lee was one of those who was asked not to come back. Permanently.\nWhich is okay by those of us at IBM, as we\u2019re keeping him way too busy to bother with card counting.\nInstead, Lee\u2019s mathematical prowess is being applied to help companies improve their marketing capabilities, a key ingredient in the IBM Smarter Commerce soup.\nAs Lee explained in his keynote session this afternoon here in Madrid, \u201cthis is the first time we\u2019re bringing together Coremetrics and Unica.\u201d He also highlighted the fact that out of the 1,700 participants here at the Summit, over 1,000 are marketeers!\nLee provided a broad overview of the Enterprise Marketing Management portfolio at IBM, explaining that \u201cwe\u2019ve shared progress as a group within IBM over the past year,\u201d sharing that also incorporates lessons learned from both the market and IBM customers.\nThe social buildout also incorporates enterprise analytics, tag management, and full mobile and social market capabilities that tie more closely together the marketing automation experience with the social realm.\nLee also debriefed quickly on two recent acquisitions, DemandTec, which expands IBM\u2019s EMM offerings with pricing, promotion, and product mix optimization, and Tealeaf, which rounds out IBM EMM solutions with customer experience management and analytics.\nAs Lee explained, \u201cA picture\u2019s worth a thousand words,\u201d and that\u2019s precisely what TeaLeaf provides, the ability to look at snapshots of individual user sessions to help determine where, exactly, it is that you\u2019re driving them crazy with your convoluted web experience!\nBut where Lee really \u201chooked\u201d the audience was in his observations about the Generation C customer, who is more connected and in control than ever! Did you know that 4 in 10 smartphone users search for an item in a store? Or that 77 percent of B2B buyers check with their peers before buying?\nWhich, he expanded, means that it must work more closely with other disciplines and functions, including merchandising, on- and offline sales, customer service, and even with IT.\nBut, Lee indicated, they can\u2019t stop there. Marketing must also share customer insights with other parts of the business so that all functions can benefit from these insights.\nFinally, they must extend that sharing of customer insights with other key stakeholders who can benefit: Partners, agencies, customer communities, and so forth.\nLee also explained that many organizations must adjust their marketing cultures to fully capitalize on the \u201cGeneration C\u201d (\u201cC\u201d for \u201cconnected\u201d) culture. They must build organizations that balance analytics and creative talents (easier said than done!), work with IT rather than around IT, and break down marketing siloes \u2014 digital and traditional marketing must consolidate and collaborate.\nFinally, accept mistakes and learn from them, and be agile enough to iterate and improve upon them. As even Lee can explain, there are only so many opportunities to double down in blackjack, and in business.\nThe enterprise marketing management opportunity vis-a-vis IBM\u2019s Smarter Commerce strategy is one of those rare opportunities.\nWell, that day of the year has finally arrived.\nThat day where we all slink into our offices after four nice, long, official holidays where (mostly, we hope) people stay away from their computers and mobile phones and tablets and God knows whatever other else connected devices just long enough to make it feel like you got some real rest (even though many of you were probably dealing with unrelated, but similarly frustrating, realities \u2014you know, like screaming kids and antagonizing in-laws).\nAnd all you could do was think about how nice it would be to come back into the nice peaceful and quiet office on Monday so you could get back to\u2026shopping.\nYes, boys and girls, cyber Monday has arrived.\nBut judging from the results of the IBM Coremetrics Benchmark Black Friday e-retailing analysis, you really need not worry about coming into the office anymore just so you can get yourself an extra slurp of broadband.\nThis is 2011, yo, all you gotta do is break out that iPad and you\u2019ll be standing in front of Macys women\u2019s wear or Best Buy\u2019s electronics section in seconds!\nBut while you\u2019re out there figuring out your Cyber Monday strategy, I\u2019m going to hit the highlights reel for the weekend in e-shopping.\nU.S shoppers apparently took great advantage of early sales this holiday, driving a 39.3 percent year-over-year increase in online Thanksgiving day spending while setting the stage for 24.3 percent online growth on Black Friday compared to the same period last year.\nConsumer spending increases. The aggressive shopping we witnessed on Thanksgiving Day this year carried over into Black Friday, with online sales increasing 24.3 percent annually.\nMobile Bargain Hunting. Black Friday also saw the arrival of the mobile deal seeker who embraced their devices as a research tool for both in-store and online bargains. Mobile traffic increased to 14.3 percent (compared to 5.6 percent last year).\nMobile Sales On the Getgo. Sales on mobile devices surged to 9.8 percent (a tripling from last year\u2019s 3.2 percent).\nApple\u2019s One Stop Shop. Mobile shopping was led by Apple, with the iPhone and iPad ranking one and two for consumers shopping on mobile devices (5.4 percent and 4.8 percent respectively). Together, the iPhone and iPad accounted for 10.2 percent of all online retail. Apparently, it ain\u2019t easy bein\u2019 an Android on Black Friday.\nThe iPad Factor. Shoppers using the iPad led to more retail purchases more often per visit than other mobile devices, leading one to wonder about the real estate to deal closing ratio. The bigger the device, the larger the average order value? Possibly, but this number can\u2019t lie: Conversion rates for the iPad were 4.6 percent, compared to 2.8 for all other mobile devices. The iPad was this weekend\u2019s e-shopping mobile king.\nSocial Influence. Shoppers referred from Social Networks generated 0.53 percent of all online sales on Black Friday, with Facebook leading the pack and accounting for a full 75 percent of all social network traffic.\nSocial Media Chit Chat. Boosted by a 110 percent increase in discussion volume compared to 2010, top discussion topics on social media sites immediately before Friday showed a focus on the part of consumers to share tips on how to avoid the rush. Topics included out-of-stock concerns, waiting times and parking, and a spike in positive sentiment around Cyber Monday sales.\nSurgical Shopping Goes Mobile: Mobile shoppers demonstrated a laser focus that surpassed that of other online shoppers with a 41.3 percent bounce rate on mobile devices versus online shopping rates of 33.1 percent.\nThis data came from findings of the IBM Coremetrics fourth annual Black Friday Benchmark, which tracks more than a million transactions a day, analyzing terabytes of raw data from 500 retailers nationwide.\nWith this data, IBM helps retailers better understand and respond to their customers \u2014 across the organization \u2014 improving sourcing, inventory management, marketing, sales, and services programs.\nYou can get more background on the study here.\nBlack Friday: U.S. Online Retail Up 20% Year-Over-Year!\nI had absolutely nothing to do with shopping today, online or off. But I seemed to have been a minority, and for those retailers looking to the holiday season to help bolster an otherwise anemic year, they will be excited by the news delivered today by the IBM Coremetrics e-retailing Black Friday Benchmark Report.\nNo flies on those guys! Apparently they were too busy counting everyone else\u2019s clicks to pursue any of their own.\nClick image to enlarge. Black Friday e-retail sales in U.S. were up 20% over the same period last year, with consumers turning to mobile devices like smartphones and tablets for their e-shopping efforts more than they ever have.\nE-retail sales at major online retailers were up 20 percent as of 3 P.M. EST this afternoon, compared to the same time on the Friday after Thanksgiving last year.\nThe survey monitors some 500 major U.S. Online retailers, and the 20 percent is in line with the 20 percent year-over-year increase IBM was reporting mid-day yesterday. However, apparently lots of folks are holding out until they\u2019ve allowed the turkey trytophan to kick in and the evening football games to start, because full-day online Thanksgiving sales ended 39 percent up over the holiday last year and they soared Thursday evening.\nMobile devices also played a much bigger role in online shopping this year, according to the benchmark. Shoppers are making 9.73 percent of their purchases from mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, about the same as Thanksgiving day. And, as much as 17.37 percent of traffic to e-retail sites is coming from mobile devices, higher than even the 15.2 recorded yesterday.\nConsumer spending increased: Online sales were up a healthy 15.9 percent, with consumers pushing the average order value up from $170.19 to $190.80 for an increase of 12.1 percent.\nLuxury goods are making a comeback. Jewelry retailers reported a 17.6 percent increase in sales.\nSocial shopping. Consumers appear increasingly savvy about their favorite brands\u2019 social presence, and are turning to their social networking friends for information about deals and inventory levels.\nThough the percentage of visitors arriving from social sites is fairly small relative to all online visitors \u2014 nearly 1 percent \u2014 it\u2019s gaining momentum, with Facebook dominating the space.\nDepartment stores. They\u2019ve become the research engine of choice for consumers looking for Black Friday deals and product promotions. As a consequence, shoppers are spending 17.7 percent more time year over year on department store sites.\nHealth and Beauty. A reported rise of 73.1 percent in the number of new consumers completing their first purchase on their sites and a 53.4 percent jump in the number of visits in which consumers completed an order.\nIn-Store Sales for Consumer Electronics and Appliances. These are expected to increase 3.5 percent this year compared to last, with consumers spending a larger-than-usual share in November, according to an analytics-based forecast from IBM\u2019s Global Business Services division.\nU.S. consumers have been increasing their savings relative to disposable income, from 2 percent in 2007 to nearly 6 percent today, which has led to strong pent-up demand for consumer electronics and appliances, both of which are typically seen as necessities in today\u2019s economy.\nStay tuned here on the Turbo blog for other upcoming reports on the holiday season\u2019s retail tidings. It\u2019s still Black Friday, we still have the weekend, and Cyber Monday is a full three days away!\nThe weekend in sports proved to be as about as exciting as I had hoped.\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Darren Clarke became the third man from that region to win a golf major in 3 of the last 6, and it was Clarke\u2019s first British Open title.\nAnd as to the U.S. Women\u2019s soccer team, they played a nailbiter of a match, but in the end the team from Japan won on penalty kicks.\nMy hat goes off to both teams. I had a whole living room full of soccer fans, and we were all nervous wrecks up to that last penalty kick that gave Japan this year\u2019s World Cup trophy.\nStill, it was an awesome game all the way around, and I wish my friends in Japan a very happy celebration. They could probably stand some good news about now!\nLater today, IBM will announces its second quarter 2010 earnings. You can check the Investor Relations site for more details.\nOn the announcement front, today saw the introduction of a new cloud-based Web analytics and digital marketing suite intended to help organizations automate online marketing campaigns across their online channels, including web sites, social media networks, and even mobile phones.\nThe new offering combines the best of Coremetrics and Unica, and provides analytics that help companies better determine the effectiveness of new products and services, fine tune their marketing campaigns, and create personalized offers in real-time across channels.\nWith 64 percent of consumers making a first purchase because of a digital experience, it\u2019s critical that marketers understand online behavior and refine their marketing activities accordingly.\nSupports deep analysis into how customers interact with a brand over time and when each marketing program is the most effective.\nUsing this technology, businesses will be able to evaluate Facebook or Twitter activity, and offer customers tailored promotions delivered to their mobile devices on the fly.\nIBM\u2019s suite also enables businesses to deliver and fine tune digital marketing programs based on what customers are doing offline.\nFor example, a consumer who purchased a new tablet in a brick-and-mortar store would receive special offers via email to purchase tablet accessories.\nThe benefit to the customer is a consistent, relevant brand experience that reflects all of their online preferences, not just what they did, read or saw on one specific site.\nThe IBM Coremetrics Web Analytics and Digital Marketing Optimization Suite is the newest addition to IBM\u2019s family of Smarter Commerce solutions,which is focused on helping companies more effectively market, sell and secure greater customer loyalty in the era of social networking and mobile computing.\nSmarter Commerce transforms how companies manage and swiftly adapt to customer and industry trends across marketing, selling and service processes that span the entire commerce cycle, putting the customer at the center of their decisions and actions.\nTo learn more about this and other marketing solutions please visit the IBM Enterprise Marketing Management site."}

We have a good understanding and it\u2019s a great relationship.\n\u201cSo, like I said, as an amateur I was relying a lot on reflex, movement, counter punching, but not as a pro, I\u2019m going to focus on sitting my weight down, catching shots, returning shots and working the body.\nI would love to say I can adapt to any shape or style but I have to be realistic, I would say that I\u2019m a thinking fighter, I can work out people\u2019s fight quite quickly so I can entertain different styles.\n\u201cWithout trying to sound arrogant or cocky I feel like I\u2019ve got the makings to go all the way, I feel like I\u2019m destined for great things and it\u2019s a matter of time until everyone else starts to believe it.\nIn 2018 I\u2019m just looking to get the whole experience, and I think if I could get 4 fights this year I would be happy with that, I\u2019m looking to soak up the experience and fight in front of a big hyped up crowd.

{"doc_id": "372", "text": "Somnath Temple is one of the twelve jyotirlinga in India. Hindu worship Lord Shiva in the form of linga and all the Shiva Linga of jyotirlinga are famous as swayambhu. Swayambhu means that manifest on its own i.e. not made by man. These lingas are self-existing and appear suddenly or mysteriously without any human efforts. When the saints or holy men see them they install them in a temple. Each of the twelve jyotirlinga, take the name of a different manifestation of Shiva. These twelve jyotirlinga are considered very holy for the Shiva devotees. All the Shiva devotees visit these jyotirlinga one by one as all are located in different locations and can\u2019t be visited all at once. It is believed that just a visit to the temple is very auspicious and all bad deeds and sins are washed away in the feet of Lord Shiva.\nAmong all jyotirlinga, Somnath is considered as the first pilgrimage site. The Dwadash Jyotirlinga pilgrimage begins with the Somnath Temple. This temple is located in Prabhas Patan, in Saurashtra-Veraval in Gujarat. This temple is destroyed and rebuilt many times. This temple follows Triveni Sangam of three rivers- the Kapila, the Hiran and the auspicious river the Saraswati. It is believed that Somraj, the Moon God had built this temple out of Gold in Satyug, then it was re-built by Ravan in Silver in Tretayug, and again it was re-built by Lord Krishna in wood in Dwaparyug and finally in stone by Bhimdev Solanki in Kaliyug. Means this Somnath temple is from ancient times showering its eternal shrines and glory on the people. At last, it was rebuilt in 1951 in Chalukya style by the architecture of Hindu temple. The construction was proposed by Vallabhbhai Patel and was completed under the then head of the temple trust K.M. Munshi.\nMoon then came to Prabhasa also known as Somnath. He went on a penance for six months where he worshipped Lord Shiva to get out of his curse. His Jaap and Tap pleased Lord Shiva and he came to bless him. Lord Shiva told Moon that he can\u2019t be completely free from the curse but his gleams will appear different every day, 15 days it will grow and the next 15 days it will hide. To gain back his luster, he bathed in the River Sarasvati and the result is the waxing and waning of the moon, and is also referred to the waxing and waning of the tides at sea shore location. Lord Shiva himself came to be known as Someshwar which means famous moon (Soma).\nShravan Maas is considered very auspicious month to worship Lord Shiva and Somnath temple is famous not only as a jyotirlinga but also as a holy place where ones sins gets washed away. Visitors love the divine worship of Lord Shiva and its abhishek, aarti and the location of the temple."}

{"doc_id": "378", "text": "A good franchise lead questionnaire is going to produce quality leads, which is one responsibility of an effective sales VP. Such individuals aren\u2019t simply seeking to produce good leads, but leads which will be good franchisees down the line. Finding the right people is the difference between a good franchise operation and a great one.\nWhat interests you about our franchise?\nDo you have any debt? If so, how much and what kind? What is your plan for paying it off?\nAre partners involved in this? Does your spouse know? What are their details?\nWhere do you see yourself in 20 years and how does this franchise fit into that?\nWhat do you like about our franchise? Dislike?\nHow do you feel about our company culture?\nWhat sort of liquid cash can you acquire?\nWhen do you think you\u2019ll be profitable?\nGreat Franchise sales VP\u2019s know that the questionnaire only paints part of the picture. Consider To Sell Is Human; everybody sells themselves to some degree. Many who might not be a good fit for your brand will \u201csell\u201d themselves. So they look excellent on paper, but they\u2019re not the right fit for your brand when you meet them. Ideally, the questionnaire helps you to foster and generate genuine face-to-face or \u201cdiscovery\u201d meetings because there\u2019s a critical human element. The conversation \u201cfilter\u201d which you apply during the discovery interview will help determine the quality of this prospect\u2019s social fit. You can be creative with questionnaire structure to produce higher quality discovery meetings.\nHow do you qualify franchise leads before the discovery meeting? Maybe Chick-fil-A has the answer: They proactively scout leads which fit criteria in a given community and reach out directly. Their model is unique in the industry but commendable; they use deductive investigation to pre-qualify leads, which is likely why it\u2019s so hard to be a franchisee of this brand. Chick-fil-a scouts a community and figures out which member within that community will have the best long-term cultural fit. Then they help this potential franchisee bring a new Chick-fil-a to this new member\u2019s community.\nIf leads pass their rigorous community qualifications and all the standard franchisee qualifications to become part of the Chick-fil-A team, a store is built. Chick-fil-A is different in that they look for the human element first, and then follow with the questionnaire. As VP of sales, you can learn from this creative strategy.\nNo matter the size of a franchise group, it is critical that franchisees are only allowed to join if they are a \u201clow-risk investment\u201d. As much as they are investing in you, you\u2019re investing in them. Questions that reveal what type of person this lead might be in the future are essential. Cultural fit is crucial, but it won\u2019t matter if the lead does not qualify financially.\nStructuring questionnaires with existing data from previous interviews can help you reduce time, aggravation, and expense during the process. Some franchise software allows you to not only design questionnaires that help optimize the refining process, but establish actionable analytics.\nGood franchise project management (PM) tools allow you to keep all this information in one place as the lead transitions to partner or \u201cgoes sideways\u201d. This helps you identify trends you missed earlier and adjust and improve your questionnaires based on the information. Good PM tools will help make your questionnaires and process be much more effective.\nYou can also plan more effectively with Franchise PM Software. Such software allows you to determine with reasonable accuracy how much time it takes for you to transition a lead from one segment of the sales process to the next.\nFrequently, this process is so nebulous, franchisors are guessing with their gut. That can work--or blow up in your face\u2014it\u2019s far better to put numbers behind the process and reduce negative fallout.\nAnother prime feature of effective PM software involves email campaigns that strategically engage prospective franchisees based on analytics. If you want to maintain the investment value of the lead throughout your induction process, frequent communication is key.\nCompanies can use a portal like Franchise Gator, which matches their website design, to gather these questionnaires. However, portals can be expensive, typically charging $30-$50 per lead. As a result, many companies prefer to connect with leads through their website, trade shows, or by the lead calling the sales team directly. To avoid exorbitant portal feeds, make it easy for leads to reach out through your own website.\nTrade shows are cross-functional for lead generation. Not only are you at the trade show to connect with potential customers, but you can also be generating high-quality franchise leads. Trade shows are a more organic way to connect with franchise leads and to build trust. By being on panels, speaking and showing expertise you can show how your brand makes money for the entrepreneur; the prospective lead will be more willing to learn about the brand if you are striving to educate rather than to sell.\nWhen it comes to your franchise lead questionnaire, you can\u2019t cover everything. But you can continuously hone it so that with each new candidate, you\u2019ve got a more effective questionnaire and a better process. A paper questionnaire is half the puzzle. The human element is just as important. Acquired analytics are key in assisting you to secure the right leads. The right franchise PM software does a great deal to simplify and improve the process."}

{"doc_id": "380", "text": "Each year, there are more than 100,000 cases of pet poisoning in the U.S. Many of these were caused by household substances that may seem perfectly harmless to you. But just because something is safe for people doesn't mean it won\u2019t hurt beloved pets. Some of the most dangerous dog poisons are foods and medications we take on a daily basis.\nDepending on how a particular substance affects your dog\u2019s body and how much was ingested or inhaled, pet poisoning symptoms can include gastrointestinal and neurological problems, cardiac and respiratory distress, coma, and even death.\nDog poison No. 1: Prescription medications for people. Drugs that might be beneficial or even lifesaving for people can have the opposite effect in pets. And it doesn\u2019t always take a large dose to do major damage.\nPrescription anti-inflammatory and pain medications can cause stomach and intestinal ulcers or kidney failure.\nAntidepressants can cause vomiting and, in more serious instances, serotonin syndrome -- a dangerous condition that raises temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure, and may cause seizures.\nDog poison No. 2: Insecticides.\nFlea and tick products. You may think you\u2019re doing your dog a favor when you apply products marketed to fight fleas and ticks, but thousands of animals are unintentionally poisoned by these products every year. Problems can occur if dogs accidentally ingest these products or if small dogs receive excessive amounts. Talk to your vet about safe OTC products.\nDog poison No. 3: Over-the-counter medications. This group contains acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen and naproxen (Advil, Alleve), as well as herbal and nutraceutical products (fish oil, joint supplements).\nDog poison No. 4: Pet medications. Just as we can be sickened or killed by medications intended to help us, cases of pet poisoning by veterinary drugs are not uncommon. Some of the more commonly reported problem medications include painkillers and de-wormers.\nDog poison No. 5: Household products, from cleaners to fire logs. Just as cleaners like bleach can poison people, they are also a leading cause of pet poisoning, resulting in stomach and respiratory tract problems. Not surprisingly, chemicals contained in antifreeze, paint thinner, and chemicals for pools also can act as dog poison. The pet poisoning symptoms they may produce include stomach upset, depression, chemical burns, renal failure and death.\nDog poison No. 6: People food. Your canine companion may look so cute as he sits there begging for a bite of your chocolate cake or a chip covered in guacamole, but not giving him what he wants could save his life. Animals have different metabolisms than people. Some foods, such as onions and garlic, as well as beverages that are perfectly safe for people can be dangerous, and sometimes fatal, for dogs.\nChocolate . Though not harmful to people, chocolate products contain substances called methylxanthines that can cause vomiting in small doses, and death if ingested in larger quantities. Darker chocolate contains more of these dangerous substances than do white or milk chocolate. The amount of chocolate that could result in death depends on the type of chocolate and the size of the dog. For smaller breeds, just half an ounce of baking chocolate can be fatal, while a larger dog might survive eating 4 ounces to 8 ounces, though 8 ounces would be extremely dagerous. Coffee and caffeine have similarly dangerous chemicals.\nAlcohol. Symptoms of alcohol poisoning in animals are similar to those in people, and may include vomiting, breathing problems, coma and, in severe cases, death.\nAvocado. You might think of them as healthy, but avocados have a substance called persin that can act as a dog poison, causing vomiting and diarrhea or worse.\nMacadamia nuts. Dogs may suffer from a series of symptoms, including weakness, overheating, and vomiting, after consumption of macadamia nuts.\nGrapes and raisins. Experts aren\u2019t sure why, but these fruits can induce kidney failure in dogs. Even a small number may cause problems in some dogs.\nXylitol. This sweetener is found in many products, including sugar-free gum and candy. It causes a rapid drop in blood sugar, resulting in weakness and seizures. Liver failure also has been reported in some dogs.\nDog poison No. 7: Chocolate. See above.\nAzaleas and rhododendrons. These pretty flowering plants contain toxins that may cause vomiting, diarrhea, coma, and potentially even death.\nTulips and daffodils. The bulbs of these plants may cause serious stomach problems, difficulty breathing, and increased heart rate.\nSago palms. Eating just a few seeds may be enough to cause vomiting, seizures, and liver failure.\nDog poison No. 9: Rodenticides, if ingested by dogs, can cause severe problems. The symptoms depend on the nature of the poison, and signs may not start for several days after consumption. In some instances, the dog may have eaten the poisoned rodent, and not been directly exposed to the toxin.\nDog poison No. 10: Lawn and garden products. Products for your lawn and garden may be poisonous to pets that ingest them.\nIf you think your dog has been poisoned, try to stay calm. It is important to act quickly, but rationally.\nFirst, gather up any of the potential poison that remains -- this may be helpful to your veterinarian and any outside experts who assist with the case. If your dog has vomited, collect the sample in case your veterinarian needs to see it.\nThen, try to keep your pet calm and call your veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) at (888) 426-4435. Experts at the APCC are available to answer questions and provide guidance 24 hours a day for a $60 consultation fee. Another option is the Pet Poison Hotline with a fee of $59 per incident.\nKeep all medications, even those in child-proof bottles, in cabinets that are inaccessible to your dog. If you inadvertently drop a pill on the floor, be sure to look for it immediately. Supervise anyone, such as the elderly, who may need help taking medications.\nAlways follow guidelines on flea or tick products.\nAlthough you can safely give some ''people foods'' to your pet as a treat, others are toxic. If you have any questions about what is safe, ask your veterinarian. Or, err on the safe side and give treats made specifically for animals.\nBe sure any rodenticides you use are kept in metal cabinets or high on shelves where your pets can't find them. Remember that dogs can be fatally poisoned by eating an exposed rodent, so always be very cautious about using these products. Tell your neighbors if you put out rat bait, so they can protect their pets from exposure, and ask them to do the same for you.\nWhen buying plants for your home, opt for those that won\u2019t cause problems if your dog happens to nibble on them. The ASPCA has an online list of toxic and nontoxic plants by species. If you choose to have toxic plants, be sure they are kept in a place where your animals can't reach them.\nStore all chemicals and cleaners in pet-inaccessible areas of your home."}

{"doc_id": "384", "text": "I was brimming with excitement all of Thursday. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about my date with Seabiscuit. I was very excited about his joining me at the theater plus the night adventures that would follow.\nI hurried home after work, took a quick shower, and headed out. It had been a warm day, and I was doubtful that I needed my jacket; however, then I remembered being cold at a previous performance in the evening. Even though I had checked the weather and saw Orinda was only predicted to be in the low 60s in the evening, I knew that up in the hills, where the theater is actually located, it can get much colder. I felt foolish carrying such a large jacket on BART and felt too warm to need it, but better safe than sorry.\nIt was good I did. By the time I arrived at the theater, it was significantly cooler. I was happy without a jacket but realized that once the sun finished setting, I would need to put it on. I waited for Seabiscuit to arrive, and was excited to see him clean-shaven\u2013as I had ordered as his Mistress. How good that he should obey so well! And he finally looked like one of his own photographs.\nI told him previously that he appeared to be a servant of the Many-Faced God because his face never seemed to match from one photograph to another. The angles were off or something seemed so strange about it. He didn\u2019t look like his photographs. I knew it was him, but how strange and different they all seemed.\nThere was a crowd, and I could tell he felt a bit shy. We hugged and kissed each other\u2019s cheeks, then held hands as we walked up the hill from Will Call to the theater.\nHe bought dinner for us at the caf\u00e9, and we continued holding hands. The line was long, and we really only had 10 minutes to eat before needing to be seated. He was impressed by my tickets and how close we were to the stage. The temperature had dropped significantly, so I put on my jacket when we were seated but he was astounded that I didn\u2019t close it until after intermission. I held his hand in his lap during the first half.\nDuring intermission, he rented a blanket while I used the restroom and got my free bag of Peet\u2019s coffee for renewing my subscription for the theater. We shared the blanket, and for the second half, he held my hand on my lap.\nThe performance was amazing, as all the shows I have seen there have been. CalShakes has done very well at selecting and directing plays that resonate with race issues going on currently, and this play was exceptionally well done in that regard. Seabiscuit enjoyed it greatly, and I told him he should return with me for all of next season. He said he would love to. It was his first time going to the theater in a very long time, and he said the final scenes with the bed on stage would linger in his memory for a long time."}

This is part 34, to read the other parts click The Rice Field Project. If you are following this project then you might remember that we had an water well made at our land. Well as we will later build a guest bungalow on an other part of our land we had the idea to have a second water well made. The new one closer to our house and use the old one for the garden and guest-bungalow. But that did not go as easy as we thought.\nThe first try was about 5 meter from our house, they found water at 6 meter but not enough to pump it up. Second try was about 10 meter from the first water well. But no water at all was found. So a third try was done about 5 meter next to the first water well. And bingo .... water. And a lot of water.\nSo the location of the first water well was just sheer luck? Anyway we will see how it works out with 2 water wells near to each other. The job was done by the same 3 people of the first water well. And although they had to try 3 times, we only paid for 1 water well, 3.500 Thai baht + some tip for the hard work. Because yes it is hard work, especially at 30\u2103!\nUpdate : And we did just paid the final payment for the house construction.

This is their story. Be sure to watch the video as well as browse through the photos as mom tells what happened from her perspective.\nBen\u2019s parents were already at the hospital for an induction. Last checked, she was 2 cm dilated and not in active labour at all. The induction medication hadn\u2019t even begun. I normally come when a client is in active labour as this early period could be slowed down by my presence. I texted with dad who told me we would touch base in an hour. I texted to see how things were going. Heard nothing for about 10 minutes and just had this gut feeling. I threw on my scrubs. My gear was already at the house and my childcare had been called in. I knew it would be today just not sure when.\nUtter disbelief. What was he talking about? She wasn\u2019t even in labour. This was a first baby. Complete as in completely dilated and at a 10? Maybe dad wasn\u2019t familiar with the terms.\nI put my keys in my pocket.\nI screamed at my childcare \u201cI gotta go, bye, I\u2019m walking out, you are on duty, bye\u201d and walked right to the car. I was driving away a minute later.\nThe drive had my heart pumping like never before. I knew this could go either way, some first time moms push for one to two hours so I might have time. Some deliver with in a couple pushes. I parked in exactly 20 minutes from when I walked out my door (went back and checked all my text time stamps).\nI ran up to maternity and heard a baby crying from a delivery room. My heart sank. I knew.\nHe was laying on her chest and it was the first natural birth that ever beat me to it!\nThis was a precipitous labor, which is defined as a labor that lasts no more than three hours from onset of regular contractions to delivery. Maybe you could call hers ultra-precipitous?\nThe room no less, was full of peace, and with in the first minute of being there I began shooting. The looks of disbelief and utter joy were plastered all over their faces.\nBen\u2019s parents have graciously allowed me to share their birth in part to glorify God publicly for his miraculous life. The images chosen, many that are not in the video, I selected almost all black and white because in this case, its just so visually stunning when laid together. In case you are wondering, my clients receive all of their images in colour and black & white for every session.\nTo Ben\u2019s parents, the joy and graciousness you carry exudes from a deep place of knowing truth. What a gift your son has in having you both to raise him. Thank you for hiring me. I\u2019m slightly terrified if you hire me again that I might just camp outside your house for a week.\nTo the hospital staff and Dr. Brandt at Netcare Blaauwberg Hospital, my sincerest thank you\u2019s for letting me run in all out of breath and document their day."}

{"doc_id": "390", "text": "I\u2019ve never understood the whole points thing, scholarships, etc. for open comps. I don\u2019t do enough open comps for it to matter \u2013 but I\u2019d love to understand it. I\u2019ve tried to look it up and other than the official rules which are like reading a law-book ( in other words make no sense to me!) I can\u2019t find a simple explanation of it all. If anyone can give a layperson\u2019s explanation it would be cool!\nI had to clarify. What to which \u201cpoints\u201d was she referring, exactly?\nMaybe you are referring to being top student or top teacher in a competition or a district or in a competition series? If that is the case, what happens is you get a certain amount of points for each entry you are in (or your instructor dances), and then more points for placing higher. Like when I got top student in San Diego it was like 8 points (or something, I don\u2019t exactly remember the point value) for 1st place, 6 for 2nd, down through 6th and then 1 point for participating. You get more points for participating more and for placing higher. Your instructor gets points for the same things, but obviously if they bring more students and dance more often, they earn more points.\nSo I checked it out, not being familiar with proficiency points. No one had ever mentioned them to me before.\nEllen, I\u2019ve looked at the proficiency point guide and I\u2019m intrigued. Seems to be a complicated system to determine which category you should dance in\u2026what age, what level, as an attempt in making sure people are competing at an appropriate level \u2013 not too high or too low. It says in the guide that USA dance will make a database online of the points so I\u2019m now trying to find that. I\u2019m curious to see where I might rank. I\u2019ve always been told that the instructor decides which category you dance at. It seems like the points might be more important for high level amateur competitors or professional couples. I\u2019ll ask Ivan about it, but who knows if he knows anything about it. It does say that you can be disciplined for dancing below your level! Thanks for asking this question. I love learning more about my favorite sport! I\u2019ll keep you updated.\nThe topic sparked my interest in a number of facets of ballroom dancing that involve points and I had a big \u2018ole conversation with Ivan about it after my lesson today.\nSadly, he didn\u2019t know about proficiency points, but he did comment on another type of points used by ballroom studios which I found intriguing. Also, I did a little more research and found on http://DanceForums.com some old comments about the proficiency points. You can see the comments I found here.\nFirst, the database is not current. I don\u2019t even know if you can find it. Someone who is on the USA Dance board must have been in the conversation because he or she commented that they needed someone to volunteer to keep up with the points. I guess you are supposed to keep track of them yourself! Well, I for one, haven\u2019t been doing that.\nSecond, the link Ellen sent me on the USA Dance page that directs you to the rules about the Proficiency points is outdated. I guess there have been changes (that a couple must now only accrue 200 points instead of the 300 mentioned in the pdf file) that aren\u2019t reflected in that edition of the rules.\nBut the plot thickens. These mystery proficiency points are only applicable to USA Dance sanctioned events.\nUSA Dance isn\u2019t the only governing body of ballroom dance.\nThere are different proficiency points and rules for the National Dance Council of America (NDCA) and the Youth College Network (YCN).\nSo there are points you accrue in competition. But after my conversation with Ivan, I have learned there are also points you can accrue at a studio. Now, I don\u2019t purport to have expertise in this area because I\u2019ve never danced in a ballroom dance franchise studio. I\u2019m going on what Ivan told me. If things are different, feel free to comment below and fill us all in. At least this is what I gather went on at Ivan\u2019s studio when he was employed by a franchised studio.\nStudents accrue points and have proficiency tests to determine what level they are at: pre-bronze, bronze, silver, etc. Then packages are sold around getting to the next level. Like for every lesson you take or every figure you learn it\u2019s recorded and there are charts of points and where you are. There are also charts proclaiming which student is which level, so you can compare yourself to other students and follow your and their progress.\nTo me, this seems a bit weird. I guess it is great for goal setting and is some form of monitoring progress, but just knowing the steps in the gold syllabus doesn\u2019t necessarily, I think, mean you are a gold level dancer \u2013 meaning that you might be dancing a gold step with bronze level technique.\nWhat it does do is give a person a sense of being able to put a feather in their cap. I\u2019ve had people ask me what level dancer I am, but since I have no points or proficiency tests to go on, I honestly don\u2019t know. I have no idea what level the steps I know are considered nor my level in terms of technique.\nSeems like another VCR manual to me, but at least this one only applies to amateurs. I still don\u2019t know what this means if I\u2019m dancing Pro/Am since my proficiency in Pro/Am shall not be used in determining my amateur proficiency level\u2026.though I don\u2019t dance Am/Am, myself!\nSheesh! I think it\u2019s an interesting topic, but still kind of a mystery even after all this writing and after all the various research!\nSo, now the ball is in your court. Do you know anything about points tracked in ballroom? What do you think of these point systems? Does your studio use them? How? Have you heard of them in the context of NDCA or USA Dance? Have you kept track of yours? What do they mean\u2026.really? I\u2019m curious to know.\nOoohhh, I\u2019m a bit nervous writing this post, but I think it is a very important subject that is not often talked about. It kind of relates to my previous post about when learning to dance that you make sure you find an instructor that can teach in a way that you can understand and process. And if it\u2019s not working out, to feel free to move on to a different instructor who can suit your needs. Sometimes that can be a little tricky. One of those situations where it is easier said, than done.\nThe topic I\u2019m talking about is whether or not as a dance student we are free agents, at liberty to dance with whichever instructor we desire and the sometimes-weird possessiveness that the instructor or studio may exhibit for his/her/its students.\nWhen it all boils down, I personally believe that I am the customer, I am the one paying to learn, and I should be able to go wherever I want to do that.\nHowever, it actually isn\u2019t as black and white as that. It isn\u2019t as easy to navigate as one might think.\nHopefully you can avoid some of the difficulties I\u2019ll mention by doing \u201cdancer-views\u201d before settling on a particular instructor. I plan to write a post later on about how to go about the process of finding and selecting an instructor, so I\u2019ll leave that for another time. However, even if you do your due diligence, it may not always be possible to stay with your current instructor indefinitely. Life happens. I\u2019m with my third instructor, and in both previous cases, there were life events that pushed that change along.\nBut for now (and for what I hope is a long, long time to come) as you know from the blog, my primary instructor is Ivan, who is an independent dance instructor. He is my #1. Any place I go to take group classes or whatever (unless it is just social dancing or I\u2019m not there enough for it to matter and it\u2019s none of their business) is aware of my instructor. Conversely, Ivan is aware that I take group classes at Inna\u2019s studio, and I often inform him if I go social dancing as well, out of courtesy.\nWith Ivan, he has made it clear that if I want to dance with other instructors for ballroom, then I need to not dance with him. Coaching would be a different situation, or a lesson with Marietta or Nona as a one time deal for styling or something would be fine too, and he\u2019d know about it.\nBut if I want to learn something that he doesn\u2019t have expertise in, like West Coast Swing, or Argentine Tango, then I just have to tell him my desire and he\u2019d be cool with that. That is the arrangement we have set up. But the point is, we had a conversation about it. At no point did I go behind his back and do things. I wouldn\u2019t want to risk losing him as an instructor. We have this agreement set up and I respect it.\nSomehow, however, I\u2019ve managed to be dancing at like three different places (sometimes more), but this is not, from what I\u2019ve heard, the \u201cnorm\u201d when it comes to ballroom dancing. And if you are going to go that road, it is extremely, extremely important to be respectful of the professionals at each location, as well as their students, and the relationships between them. It is extremely, extremely important to be upfront and clear on what relationship you have to each place you dance. Otherwise, things can get very messy, very quickly!\nFrom my past personal experience, and from that of others who have shared with me, some teachers and studios can become almost possessive of their students. I can even understand it, to a point. They want to protect their business and that only makes sense. However, I feel like it comes from a scarcity mindset \u2013 the idea that the instructor or studio has to keep the student away from any other dance influences for fear that the new or different dance instructor or class may \u201csteal\u201d the student away is focused on a fear of losing something. From my perspective, it isn\u2019t possible to steal a student. If you are providing the value a student is looking for, they won\u2019t go anywhere, no matter how many \u201cother\u201d group classes they take, or instructors they are exposed to. This would be an abundant mindset.\nBut the fact is, some of the studios just don\u2019t offer everything a person might be looking for. Not everyone offers Lindy Hop, or ballet. If I can\u2019t get those at my primary studio, and I want them, I should be at liberty to go elsewhere to find them. My primary studio can always take that as feedback and grow such areas if they so desire. But to prevent me, threaten me, or guilt me into not doing more dancing if I have that desire, I feel is poor behavior. To allow myself to let any threat, or guilt deter me from what I really want is not okay either.\nHowever, there is really something to be said for sticking with one instructor or studio when its good for you, even if it is tough. Sometimes there are issues to work through, even if you adore your instructor. I\u2019ve had a lesson or two with Ivan where we had to get clear on a few things and it wasn\u2019t necessarily comfortable. But I\u2019d choose being uncomfortable and having open, honest communication, than to lose a fab instructor any day of the week. That is just me.\nAgain, as mentioned in a previous post, there isn\u2019t necessarily one \u201cright\u201d way, the be-all and end-all way of dancing. That means that each instructor you learn from will give you some similar information, and some very different information than others. This can be very confusing and muddle the clarity of your dancing. A person has to be careful of not always thinking the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. It might be very green right where you are. Sticking it out with your instructor may be the best choice you ever make. Also, if you do decide to receive instruction from multiple sources, be aware that you may need to filter some of the information and make sure that you apply those things that will best serve you while leaving the rest behind. This will take discernment on your part.\nIf the time does come when you feel the need to change instructors, I\u2019d encourage you to do it in as clean, clear, and honest manner as possible. Although some people just stop taking lessons, not only can this strain your relationship with the instructor and the studio, but it steals the opportunity for the instructor or studio to respond to your issue, and even if the issue can\u2019t be amended, it robs them of the feedback you could provide so they don\u2019t recreate the same pitfall with another student.\nSo, to answer the primary question of this post, am I a free agent? Yes\u2026and no. Yes, because I take classes at a variety of places that I feel will enhance and enrich my dancing. But no, because I am very clear that Ivan is my primary ballroom instructor and I\u2019m not going anywhere else for that. I mean, the entire relationship is built on trust. You can\u2019t have trust if you are not engaging in open, honest communication or going behind someone\u2019s back. I guarantee it will show up in your dancing.\nWhat about you? Do you only dance with one instructor at one location? Why? How does that work for you? Or do you dance a lot of places? What positive or negative experiences can you share around that? What advice would you give someone who was considering dancing more than one place or changing instructors? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts!"}

{"doc_id": "400", "text": "Esther and Kenso fell in love with , and chose , the stunning Tuscany themed backdrop of Central Florida\u2019s Bella Collina Wedding Venue for their Central Florida April wedding and what a wedding it was! How can you possibly go wrong with a gorgeous bride, a handsome groom, and a beautiful venue?? This beautiful Haitian couple chose a classic contemporary and elegant theme for their Central Florida wedding. We have such a history with Esther\u2019s family ( We have already photographed 3 of her siblings weddings with 2 to go!) that Stan and I were really excited as well as nervous about capturing Esther and Kenso\u2019s Bella Collina Wedding just perfectly. Everything went smoothly with the talented team of Lynn Stuckas of Your Events by L & L who was in charge of coordinating Esther and Kenso\u2019s stunning Central Florida Bella Collina wedding. Esther\u2019s flowers were just beautifully done by Weddings by Carly Anes, and complimented her stunning mermaid dress from Demetrios Bridal. Her off white mermaid dress was heavily beaded, with lots of sparkle to compliment the dress, while the form fitting skirt enhanced and complimented Esther\u2019s perfect curves. The finishing touches were hair and makeup and beautifully done by LeJeune Artistry . The reception ballroom at Bella Collina was beautifully decorated with linens by Eli of Linen Creations, and D.J Geordany Jean Baptiste made sure that the music was a crowd pleaser, playing a well rounded selection of music from soca to hip hop to R & B. Of course we must include that Esther and Kenso\u2019s stunning Bella Collina Wedding was captured by S & S Photography and their beautiful video captured by Kelvin Aultman .\nBrandy and Dave met working aboard the Disney Fantasy Cruise ship in 2013. Brandy worked with the cruise staff team while Dave worked on the ship wide tech team. After nearly 4 years of sailing the seven seas with Mickey Mouse, the two lovebirds decided it was time to start a life together on land, in far away New Zealand. For Brandy\u2019s 28th birthday Dave surprised her with a fantastic trip to the Bay of Islands and Cape Reinga, the northern most point of New Zealand. It was here, overlooking the ocean, on the last day of their trip, that Dave got down on one knee and popped the question. Brandy of course said \u201cyes!\u201d and the excitement of planning their September 22 nd wedding began.\nWhen planning their wedding Brandy and Dave wanted a theme that reflected their life together thus far. They loved traveling, and decided to go with a vintage travel theme to match the grandeur feeling of the Ballroom at Church Street Station in downtown Orlando. Each table was themed around a different city in the world that they had visited together and of course they had to incorporate , at the head table no less, the Disney Fantasy Ship where they met. A \u201d Where in the world are you sitting? \u201d map directed guests to which city in the world they would be sitting and dining at. Party favors included a delicious candy station which included many different treats from the U.S , the U.K and New Zealand. A nice personal touch were the added photographs of each of their grandparents, on their wedding days ,which added the perfect vintage touch to their Ballroom at Church Street Wedding.\nSince Brandy and Dave are from two different countries the most important thing they wanted to make sure happened on their wedding day was getting their friends and families together, allowing everyone to get to know each other. Their guests came all the way to Orlando from Australia, the United Kingdom and Switzerland to celebrate with them, and celebrate they did with delicious food, lively dancing and drinking all night long until their fiery sparkler departure. Their Ballroom at Church Street Station Wedding was a huge success, that brought together 2 families, and 2 different cultures.\nAll wedding days are a blur but no one will forget the epic Maid of Honors \u201d rap speech \u201d nor the fun father/daughter mash up dance Brandy did with her dad. Dave\u2019s fondest memory was the tender and sweet dance with his grandmother to her favorite song. Congratulations Brandy and Dave, your wedding was great fun and S&S wishes you both many many years of happiness together!!\nI honestly can say that Madalyn was one of the most relaxed brides I\u2019ve ever encountered , lucky Aaron! When a bride \u201cgoes with the flow\u201d so to say the stress of the wedding is greatly reduced. If you have no theme other than choosing things you like how can you go wrong? Instead of having to find things that fall within your theme or \u201cgo with \u201d your theme you can simply find what works for you thus opening up all sorts of possibilities. Madalyn and Aaron chose Maison et Jardin for their beautiful April 1st Orlando wedding and it was refreshing and surprising to me how beautiful and elegant everything was for a bride who had no theme and no preconceived ideas about how her Central Florida wedding day should be.\nCongratulations to this wonderful and so in love couple, S & S Photography wishes you many years of health and happiness!!\nWe went with a personal friend to DJ our wedding. He knows our preferences in music and he was so eager to make us happy on our big day!\nWould you believe that Mike & Paige\u2019s parents and brother kept this proposed proposal secret for 3 WEEKS!! How her Mom kept that from her is beyond me, I would have burst from excitement! Paige and Mike eventually chose the beautiful Mission Inn Resort for their Orlando wedding. The day was rainy but nothing could dampen Paige and Mike\u2019s excitement! All the planning , all the details, all came together ( with considerable help from their talented planner Katie Jimenez, owner of Big Day Celebrations, Katie@BigDayCelebrations.com) and their Mission Inn Resort wedding was a true celebration of the joining of 2 lives and 2 families. Here we are 2 months later and these 2 wonderful people are now busy helping others. Paige is a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner and Mike works in Law Enforcement protecting and serving the citizens of Orlando.\nStan and I wish Paige and Mike a long, happy and healthy life together. These are 2 people that are thoughtful, kind, smart, gorgeous, and just plain NICE\u2026good people as they say, with wonderful families supporting them. Lots of love to them!!\nAdvice from the happy couple\u2026\u201d Always think about why your partner may be acting the way they are, whether they be happy, sad, mad,anxious etc. We find that this brings us peace and helps us to react in an appropriate way. We also encourage couples to \u201d not sweat the small stuff\u201d . Is it really worth your energy to bring up that annoying thing that happened last week ; the answer is usually no. When there are big issues, talk about them and again, think about why your partner is acting the way they are. If you know what may be causing them their sadness, anger, anxiousness only then can you move in a direction towards happiness! Great words of wisdom Mr & Mrs. Hamm!\nAlyssa and Bud\u2019s beautiful Venice wedding!\nBud and Alyssa first met at a Chilies restaurant in 2013 after initially meeting on line via \u201cChemistry.com\u201d. Clarence, AKA Bud, worked the night shift as an Orlando Police Officer and Alyssa, as she says,\u201dbeing surrounded by engineers limited our dating scene so we both turned to online dating and it all turned out for the best!\u201d Bud said that,\u201d they talked for hours, about everything from work to zip lining, and unbeknownst to them, began laying the foundation of what would become a wonderful and lasting relationship.\u201d Bud\u2019s proposal began with an invitation to dinner and a movie, after which they headed for their favorite local spot, Cranes Roost. \u201d It\u2019s where we first became officially boyfriend and girlfriend, and had our first kiss.\u201d Bud even had a photographer there who, under the false pretense of \u201cpracticing\u201d on them, proceeded to take their picture. Alyssa went along and agreed to \u201d have some stranger take our photo\u201d Bud, after the first photo, got down on his knee and proposed! She said YES and now here they are, happily married newlyweds in 2016.\nAugust 6 th was the big day and Bud and Alyssa agreed that they wanted an outdoor themed wedding, without the outdoors\u2026\u201d Too hot for a Florida August outdoor wedding\u201d said Alyssa. They chose the beautiful Plantation in Venice, a spot on the East coast close to where Alyssa grew up. One thing Alyssa knew for certain was that she wanted a cookie table at the reception. \u201d I was raised by my Mom and always grew up close to her, she was the one there through thick or thin. My Dad lived in NY so when I visited him he would make sure we had our time together by waking me up in the middle of the night and we would have Oreos and milk\u201d How super sweet..pun intended!\nEverything came together beautifully on their wedding day in large part due to Alyssa being a very hands on and involved bride. \u201cEverything was set up and made by myself or one of my amazing bridesmaids- from the homemade jams and the signs to the center pieces and the kids table!\u201d Apart from a tiny thunderstorm that blew through as the ceremony was about to start the wedding was a success\u2026lively & full of dancing and laughter, which ended with an exciting ecofetti departure. Alyssa and Bud Stan and I wish you two lovebirds a long, safe and prosperous life together and want to thank you for inviting S & S to be a part of such a momentous occasion in your lives!\nAfter 7 years of dating Chris unexpectedly proposed to Pam in June of 2015 at a Styx concert! \u201cWe had seen them twice before and were super excited to be able to go again. The show was incredible and we had a great hotel which we ended up at after the concert. Our room had a view overlooking a river and he suggested we take a walk along the boardwalk. I was a little curious since it was an odd time of night to go (around 11:30pm I think) but it was beautiful. We walked onto the bridge over the river and joked about how many spiders there were (I am afraid of them of course). He told me how much he loved me and promised he always would then asked if I would do the same and when I said yes he pulled out the ring. I promptly dropped the water bottle that I was holding onto his foot, I was so surprised! But we laughed and I practically screamed yes and the rest, as they say, is history.\u201d Pam\u2019s Mother had purchased a dress for her to wear at her prom many years ago at the Goodwill store in her high school home town of Lockhart , for $14.00. She ended up not being able to go to her Senior Prom and the dress stayed with her as she moved and relocated 3 times\u2026.she loved her dress too much to part with. No occasion seemed worthy of it, until Chris proposed\u2026\u201dAfter Christopher and I got engaged I had no doubt that I would wear my long lost dress, it was perfect. The theme, flowers and decor all fell into place after that! \u201d Stan and I loved Pam\u2019s entire look\u2026from her dress to her beautiful summer flowers in her hair, the inspiration coming from her childhood\u2026\u201dMy mother wore a flower crown for her wedding and I remembered how much I loved playing with it when I was younger. I thought about buying a crown online but the cost was way higher than I expected and the colors were good but not perfect. It took many trips to a handful of craft stores but I was able to find the flowers that I really wanted and after reading some DIY articles I decided to make my own crown. All in all it cost around $35 (for the stuff I actually used) and took about 18 total hours.\u201d The guest list for their intimate July 31st wedding was short..her parents, his parents , his sister and boyfriend and a favorite Aunt\u2026\u201dOur parents, my aunt, and Christopher\u2019s sister and her boyfriend have truly been our support system and very best of friends over the last 5 years which made them the most important people to have with us on our wedding day.\u201d The ceremony was in a beautiful park tucked away in a Longwood neighborhood, with dinner at Lake Mary\u2019s FishBones.Congratulations to a sweet, unique and beautiful couple!!\nKarla & Steven Bayes chose one of Orlando\u2019s premier wedding locations for their beautiful March wedding\u2026yes we are late posting this but better late than never! Orlando\u2019s ChampionsGate Resort is a gorgeous Central Florida location perfectly suited to hosting Central Florida weddings. This venue is beautifully decorated, especially the courtyard and ballrooms. The accommodations are luxurious , the cuisine exceptional and the service superb. S & S Photography enjoyed working with a talented , organized and detail oriented co-ordinator and her team, Xiomarra Sanchez, owner of A Nite To Remember Events. ( Niteevents.com) Xiomarra and her team ensured that every detail, every desire, every element and every aspect of the wedding day was meticulously addressed , handled and taken care of immediately,for the bride and groom. When I asked Xiomarra why Steven and Karla chose S & S Photography for their Central Florida wedding photography needs she answered\u2026\u201dS & S was a no brainer when picking a wedding photographer for Karla and Steven. Charlene and Stan were the photographers for Karla\u2019s Mothers wedding a few years back and they LOVED them! Working with S & S is EASY and a PLEASURE. I LOVE Charlene\u2019s energy. The pictures speak for themselves. EXCELLENT photography and an EXCELLENT company\u201d. We always look forward to working with A Nite To Remember Events and we look forward to the change in photography needs of Karla and Steven\u2026from being their wedding photographers to, one day, becoming their FAMILY photographers!\nIt was so wonderful to be the wedding photographers for a couple that truly compliments each other and are so in love with each other! Heather and Todd\u2019s Bella Collina wedding was absolutely wonderful and touching beyond words, just perfect. Their outdoor traditional wedding ceremony on the lawn at Bella Collina was romantic and emotional\u2026watching Todd try to stay composed while Heather walked towards him on her Dad\u2019s arm had me tearing up! After the ceremony we had so much fun taking their wedding pictures\u2026under the Bell Tower, down by the bridge\u2026we\u2019re always able to find great locations for wedding pictures at the Tuscan themed Bella Collina. The evening was filled with joy and laughter and everyone there had an amazing time celebrating the union of two amazing people!"}

{"doc_id": "405", "text": "I figured if I could do it at all, I needed the help of the big guns. My 400mm f/2.8 lens would have worked nicely, it would allow me to zoom into the moon to fill the frame and still let plenty of light in to give me the best chance of a capture. I ran into two problems. First off, doubled \u2013 the 400mm 2.8 lens goes to 800mm f/5.6. Then, the more zoomed in you are, the more the movement of the subject in the frame. I had settled on a 1.4x extender which would get me close to 600mm with just a one stop penalty to put me at f/4.\nNext was the camera. I have a Canon Rebel 35mm film SLR that I bought on eBay for $1. It had controller issues, but thankfully the camera just so happened to work set to manual. I gave the inside a coat of urethane, set up some glass guides to hold a plate and shot it. 600mm, f/4 \u2013 ten seconds. And that\u2019s the plate you see to the right.\nFast forward ten or so months I just so happen to be interested in seeing what I can achieve with the setup again. My converted SLR has since gone missing in the attic and I really didn\u2019t want to permanently convert one of my many other 35mm film SLR cameras to wet plate. So for a few minutes I looked at the back of the camera and came up with a game plan on a plate holder that turned a 35mm camera into a wet plate camera.. And the best thing was that it was reversible. That is, if you\u2019re careful to not drip corrosive silver nitrate into the body.\nBecause the material is just a millimeter and a half thick I decided to hollow the center with no corners and then just stick corners on myself with a good metal to plastic glue. The corners themselves are cut pieces of trophy plate.\nOnce the glue was dried the holder gives a nice snug fit in the film compartment of the Canon Rebel 35mm body! I hope to get to making some images soon with it!"}

Also, whenever I try to run a loco through either turnout, it derails! Close visual inspection does not reveal any immediately obvious reason for this to be happening, and I am moving at less than 10 mph with the points properly set, so I can't see that it's anything I'm doing, either. Help???\nPlS NEVER feel bad if something is not working(lucky happen very rare!) as we all know very well certain things(N3V bugs) we have no control but can repair luckily at least so i feel good when i can help.\nby tonight or tomorrow dec. 31st latest I will have a updated version of CPR Mountiain Sub and Rogers Pass both under release 1.0.2.\nIf you are interested to receive please email me on roystrainz together with information on your username so I can provide each one with a newer version.\nupdate contains replaced corrupted switches, repaired textures dissolved left and right and also a new speed and signal update.\nThe signal update will cover Viktor Lake till half way Lake Kinbasket to Donald Station.\nPlease report any missing, corrupt or not working item so we can update them in the next version end of january 2013.\nthanks for all the nice post and help to get this blog getting better and more lively. Please post any remark, suggestion, idea, wish, comment in general as llong as it is constructive and positive.\nMany thanks again and happy, happy new year!!!\nOk this morning test revealed signal 1100S is flashing yellow top left. the V2 HUD is showing green. I consider this not to bad and would accept the HUD not to be correct. The more once the train passed the signal it turned yellow for S 1095S so proofed the HUD is little bit off. Your take and please do not be shy to post something here.\nTrouble with the 1.0.2 download. I'm getting a file not found error. Possibly because the link says crp rather than cpr?\nHappy New Year to all of you!!!!!!!!\nI confirm that the download of version 1.0.2 and the installation in Trainz went as expected, ie. no problems at all.\nThanks for such good service and for such a superb route.\nThanks Gilles most other Roy's trainzers confirmed also good execution of the new release and yes works as expected, thanks for the ice comment.\nHi everyone! I want to thank Roy for an AMAZING route (I bought the 3-in-1 CPR Mountain Sub)!! The detail is ridiculous and I cannot even imagine the effort and time it took to create this route. Today I spent some time reading the new PDF instructions for the CMTM System (http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showt...7-CMTM-Upgrade) and was wondering if anyone else other than myself is crazy enough to attempt creating at least one session utilizing it. It seems like a daunting endeavor and I have no doubt that it would be an intense effort. However, I believe that a few of us dedicated enough may be able to team up and put something quite impressive together for this equally impressive route. Anyone have any thoughts or ideas? I especially would like Roy to chime in here too. Thanks!\nEnough industries to do the first steps with lumber industries rolling stock and truck bringing the lumber from the forest..eg.\n64WarHorse, yes, I think that there are enough industries, esp if you include the whole Mountain Sub. Not to even mention what Roy here has proposed (integrating it into his upcoming additional route(s)). CMTM does support all sorts of cool scenarios as mentioned by Roy, not just yard/switching duties specifically. I am in the process of learning the new CMTM version (v.4) and would gladly contribute as much time/effort that I can to developing some sessions if we do it in a team fashion. :) Maybe we can start small at first and make some very basic sessions/scenarios to see how it goes. If all works out well then we can collaborate and come up with some truly epic sessions for these awesome routes! This idea is very exciting for me and if some of you share my enthusiasm (esp Roy), I really think we could build something legendary here. Idk. Maybe we can pull DAP (CMTM creator) into this somehow too.\nOkay, colour me intrigued. So where do we start? I suppose the first question would be, do we need to modify any rolling stock for CMTM?\nThis is the most expensive ad-on I have ever bought, but I consider it worth every penny.\nKeep the spirit high. :) I really look forward to following the devlopment of Your project.\nSteve i agree i will tell Ray to change the background in a neutral easy to read color monday! promise!\nChrisD yeeeehhh wow that feels good you like it as so many did already before you and yes it is a marvel and yes worth every penny you spent There is so much to discover it will take you a lot of time to find out and still not see it all,........that means yes i spent a lot of time creating this and hope to finish the next section soon.\nRailworks user here that just had to see what Trainz was capable of in its most extreme! Picked up Trainz on 75% discount and bought the Rogers Pass route from your site. The level of detail in this route is amazing. Im a routebuilder in Railworks, and I know how long it takes to build anything. I cant imagine it being any different in Trainz.. Your work is really and I mean really fantastic! Its all in the details as they say and your route has it all. Take care all and thanks again for your hard work Roy!\nHello all! Sorry for the few days absence but I've been quite busy lately. Anyway, I am almost done reading and re-reading the CMTM documentation and would soon like to start collaborating with those of you interested in helping me out with some basic CMTM session ideas and subsequently creation. All of those interested should PM me on the main Trainz forums thread and send me their e-mail addresses so we can communicate more efficiently. Or, feel free to e-mail me directly at runthat1@gmail.com.\nsaw that one too1 I did straighten a track segment and did not realize the signposts were separate and so got this cosmetic error. Moved the post and fixed already, thanks for reporting.\nThank you for this nice route it is wel very long to drive cpr mountain sub -)) my wife is killing me.\nGuillaume, i cannot advice you what is a less of more painful death, killed by your wife or trainz excitement, lol.\nThanks 4 sharing, Ning laughs she understand.\nHopefully this will work in TS12, seeing errors as I install, previous versions errors, warnings. All help is greatly appreciated. Thanks for the routes!\nall related to JVC grass items by author jankvis.\nmissing deps or unknown deps 99% of the time are caused by to many cdp's installed at the same time in Content Manager Program! So if jankvis has unknown ora ny other look for the author and reinstall that group like here for Jankvis go to group 3 dependencies you downloaded and reinstall the group J in there, should work flawless honest.\nhmm working in my dungeon on Mount Stephens/Spirals/Lake Louise area Laggan sub.....sssst top secret.\n\"Roy, the screenshots of the Mountain Subdivision are phenomenal. Have you done the whole thing to absolute scale? What sources did you use (or are you a railroader)? What version of Trainz will this run on and are there related kuids included?\"\nLike Google real scale and detail as far as possible.\nRunning TS12 latest version 49922.\nThanks a million Roy! You are a wonderful and patient support. Everything is up and going, beautifully! Now for that latte, sit back, relax and enjoy.\nThursday Feb 27th I will upload release 1.03 of the CPR Mountain Sub. Claim yours by sending an email to me and i will link an upload for you. Have a great week!\ndid you have any succes implementing the CMTM system for our routes? let us know what the current status is ok?\nHello! Sorry for the lack of updates, but I was out-of-state enjoying Mardi Gras in New Orleans for a few weeks. :) But yes, CMTM DOES work with the routes and it works quite well actually. I had started to collaborate with another member here but he hasn't replied to my last e-mail. He had some VERY good session ideas which I was excited to work on with him. He had suggested doing multiple CMTM sessions, each one building upon the previous one(s). I will attempt to contact him again. Otherwise, I, myself, have begun testing CMTM implementation on the CPR Mountain Sub route (3-in-1) and am now trying to come up with some of my own session ideas. If ANYONE else here would like to help, PLEASE contact me via e-mail or PM on the forums.\nMardi Gras that has been a while for me.... very nice time!\nWell CMTM that sounds good, let me know when you have something for me to test here and give ideas to you as feedback. If lucky not to long we have a connection to the Laggan sub to run real CMTM!\nKeep up the excellent work and keep me in the pict.\nCPR Mountain Sub release 1.0.3 is ready for dl.\nemail me and I open in your account for dl!\nHello all! I must apologize for the delay in providing any updates regarding implementing CMTM 4 on the CPR Mountain Sub. I am just starting to get over a nasty bout with bronchitis/upper respiratory infection and have not been able to devote much time to Trainz or much else aside from sleep (and coughing my lungs out). Steve (I am now unsure of his Trainz username here) contacted me awhile ago about his interest and desire to help me get some CMTM sessions thought-out and started. I will be contacting him later today to continue to work out the details of some of his ideas (which are really awesome btw!!). Not going to ruin the surprise or anticipation, but due to the route's huge size and unique layout of industries, yards, and portals to subsequent routes that Roy has mentioned, the sessions Steve has suggested as some possibilities really do a great job of taking those factors into account.\nRoy, yes!, CMTM 4 can and DOES work with the route(s) and YES!, it should definitely be something you take into consideration for future updates, upgrades, and new routes/expansions. Steve and I both came to the same conclusion that adding CMTM to existing rolling stock is a very simple matter of just adding some lines to the config.txt files. However this poses a potential problem with the original content creators' licensing/hosting mandates. I am not sure what to do about this potential issue, but I am sure we will find a way.\nkep up the good work guys, i work hard to get the daunting task of texturing over and over again certain areas to my liking but as i get older (like all of you) every day, day by day I get more picky and say to myself time is not of the essence, quality, pride of work and fun of doing it makes the difference.\nif this continues I close the blog and concentrate only on supporting you guys my unbelievable nice cosy and great roys trainz family. SP1 is the door closer for me with trainz although I will support you guys to the end of the 5 major routes for the next years to come and look seriously for another alternative than N3V.\ni not understand what fun they have spamming this blog. there is no financial gain nor fight or dispute of any kind related unless they show their face like we do.\nugly but it seems to make them happen.\nGarbage not only fills our oceans and kills habitat.\nI just finished testing a way around the grotesque bug existing for years far as TRS 2009 and now even blocking my routes from working with tunnels.\nIt is not a copmplete guarantee it should work now for you to so pls dl it and test it once I uploaded only CPR marked as 57720_CPR. i not upgrade any smaller route instead I will teach you how to spli them yourselves from a certain release for your own enjoyment. Kepp all routes updated is to much work right now and easier to split the biog one local at your desk.\nYess, they failed to block me here is a version that will work at least it does on my computer 57720! I will now start prep upload for the route with tunnels working but its new tunnels not the old one i did change little things in the config too of the tunnels.\nOk just uploade the latest CPR version working with big tunnels in 57720 SP1 and also uploade the 577203rdparty_fix for deps new tunnels you need to dl again. sorry for the incovenience but thank N3V for all the mishap and fuzz they create and deny.\nI am not sure how to update my Rogers Pass to SP1. Please advise.\nNiels send me an email and acc namr and see what we can do ok?\nMaybe You should take a look at Open Rails when You get a few moments to spare.\nThis is where I have moved after giving up on TS12 and its \"Service Pack\".\nThis freeware Train Simulator (at 0.8 rev 1561) uses at present existing MSTS Routes, but is running on 4 cores and is revised several times each week.\nBug reporting and fixing is a breeze compared to N3V, and the team even works for nothing.\nVisual range from the CAB, where I am supposed to be when I drive a train, is 4 Km\u00b4s and can be set even higher If You want to, but 4 Km\u00b4s is GREAT sustaining a 100+ frame rate.\nThe driving experience is CLASSES Higher than Trainz.\nSorry for rubbing salt in Your wound, but my wound is just as great thanks to N3V, and You said in a previous post that You might change platform.\nJust wanted to let you know that after a fresh install of TS12 SP1 and CPR Mountain Sub 57720 I am simply amazed.\nNever before have I been able to run with 5000MT draw successfully. Usually I cannot even open up the CPR as it locks up my computer. I have never been able to run it with all sliders maxed out but with TS12 SP1 and CPR 57720 I have no problems.\nThe graphics are a huge improvement as is the sound.\nIn fact the only minor issue I have is a slight stutter when the scenery detail slider is on normal or high with the other sliders at max value. Smooth as silk if scenery detail is on low. this is unheard of on my humble computer. I will play with the slider settings a little more as I am sure there is a better compromise re the stutter.\nI have kept the TS12 pre SP1 install just in case, but I am really loving the 57720 version so much.\nI will report back after testing in a heavy yard area and with other trains about.\nThat's all for now, Andrew.\nsorry to hear you leave.\nWell if Open rails has a modeller similar to trainz or better, if the dbase of 3rd party freeware objects to choose from is similar or better, if there is a way to \"move\" \"recreate the same DEM, networks, road,splines and locations of existing objects ....what else.\nI know the problem, and there is no easy solution.\nAs for the assets, there may be a way forward. Most assets are built with some kind of 3D modeller, and if the raw files (before export to Trainz) is at hand they can be exported to MSTS as well.\nI am sure we will never get to a quater of a million assets, but right now N3V is voiding a batch of these, so..\nI not need all dls items so far 400 are faulty in my trainz dbase. ouch but can live with it for the moment.\nthanks for your support dear friend say hello home from all of us!!\nNew version of CPR Mountain Sub TS14 release 1.0.5 now available.\njust uploaded the 1.0.5 release which runs very nice and is the best ever driver version so far in 10 years! Scenery and quality is beyond expectations and a complete surprise probably for N3V too they never check or report things anyway.\nOGL is now finally the way to go and has better fps too when tweaking your Nvidia.\nPersonally I am most happy with driver as the speedtrees and my textures now do VERY well!!!\nI just made a free roam around Your route and the memory usage peaked at 2,454,000 Kb, so Trainz definately uses more than the usual 2 Gb. And, no locking or long thinking pauses.\nRoy, thanks again, I have donwloaded all 1.0.5, do I need all these if I have the previous version?\nIf you dl already earlier revs deps you not need to dl again same.\nChris thanks for the link it seems to work better than expected!\nIs there a way to undo the 4GB patch? My trainz.exe file is changed, cannot apply patch #2. Thanks.\nyou run into the same booby trap too like me.\nCurrently i make some backups of older TS212 versions to an old HDD but a slow one. After done I will than carefully upgrdae another 57720 on my SSD and install same way you do.\nI lost my major HDD backup disk incl my original TS12 files from trainz setup. Not in the mood now to see if i can dl them again from trainz... Maybe when we finished supplying N#V with all the bugs they will fix them for the next TS14 for sure and use us as their testers like always.\nthere is and never will be a rollback from them so when goes wrong you have to uninstall reinstall crazy but true as far as I know.\nkeep me us posted and you can post in roy doors thread so other can learn from it.\nThat is Your original file. Just delete the Trainz.exe and rename tha backup.\nOk guys this evening uploaded tons of kuids upgraded to trainz build 3.5 to be used in TS12 49922 and 87898.\nIf your interested dl the 5 groups on the deps page of your profile.\nRoy, just found your website by chance, looked at your route pics. they are the best I've seen. You are an artist.\nFor all those using the CPR Mountain freeware route with s301 ZR grasses which unfortunately not do the job at all. I did replace them today but the route is not updated yet.\nHere is a way to use replace assets and you can dl via your profile the Pofig-JVC frewware cdp with the grasses needed.\nI did work on a proper replacement for the S301 grasses for the freeware grass version of the CPR route.\nI thought that those from jvc in the pofig lib could do the job till one decides to change/upgrade to ST_2 grasses if he/she likes them more.\nfind near track following item \"ZR~(Gr-1)Grass R-Dark green-2 mtr\"\nopen in surveyor main menu replace assets and place this object in left side as assets to replace!\nclick current selection only to make it replace all in the route!\n\"3D1_Pg-JVC_gr1_22\" is asset to replace with!\n3D1_Pg-JVC_gr2_58 asset to replace with!\nIn case you are not familiar with I can make tomorrow a short video how to but bet you know this command how to use.\nRoy, a query please. I am in the process of writing a Session for CPR to be uploaded (hopefully) to the DLS.\nI have the freeware S301 grasses at the moment. If I replace them with the 3D1 grasses does your map still retain your kuid?\nIf I upload a Session with S301 grasses will other players with other versions of grasses still be able to download and play a Session from the DLS?\nI not have experience with creating sessions to that level of detail how trainz would handle it bit from the surveyor handling this it should work as long as the other side has the same grass it will show that grass.\nMost probably the session would have missing deps (grasses) if the other party not have those grasses in his/her dbase.\nWe have to test this and see or discuss with other more experienced session users on the forum.\nThe eeasiest and most forward way for you however would be to make these grasses Gr... now used mandatory to dl and install when someone dl your session.\nI have never used Replace Assets before so I'm not sure if it also replaces your kuid with mine for the map. That would be no good to upload a Session to the DLS.\nI'll play safe for the moment and keep to the S301 grasses until my Session is released. After that I can experiment.\nI think you are right in that another player would have missing deps but that should'nt affect the playability of the Session.\nBTW, what is the correct spelling. Illecillweat or Illecillwaet? Both are used in the map. I would like to know the correct one for use in html messages.\nBefore you release any session on the dls make sure that not inadvertedly parts of the payware route are linked or available thru the session on the dls.\nI never used sessions in depth but I think i saw once a large route file linked in the sessions data file that was the major part of the route.\nThis we have to avoid you understand.\nReplace asset is easy and handy so pls use it and let me now the new grasses do the job.\nIllecillewaet is the correct name.\nI understand your concerns about people getting hold of your route through other means. That will not happen with me. I shall be uploading 2 files to the DLS when ready. One is the Session and the other is a HTML file which will contain the instructions, messages, etc.\nNothing of your route is included apart from your kuid in the Session config.txt that gives the map being used. What this means is that if someone hasn't bought the route and downloads the Session, they won't be able to play it as the route will be a 'Missing Dependency'.\nWith your permission I'll add into the DLS description that the Session uses a Payware route only available from you at Roy's Trainz. You never know, it might bring in a few extra sales! If someone has already bought the route then everything is peachy.\nI've started the Session at Revelstoke CPR Yard and have now reached Illecillewaet (correct spelling thanks).\nI'll tidy up here and save a backup to external HD before I try replacing the grasses.\nthanks for the nice post and agree with you.\nSorry for the late approval of the post.\nMy webmaster adviced me to go this cumbersome way to approve outside posts since hackers/spammers keep bombarding the website relentlessly what fun they think they have is unclear to me but this world has more unclear habits and things happening.\nThanks for the reply. I agree with you, these hackers are a menace.\nI installed the grasses ok but what I feared would happen, did. I could only save them in a new map with my kuid. This of course is no good as I need to upload a Session for use with your map, your kuid.\nWhat I think I'll do is to continue on to Wakely and stop there. I'll upload the Session and explain that it can only be played with your S301 map. I'll wait and see if there is any positive interest/feedback before deciding whether to carry on to Golden.\nDon't bother replying to this post. I'll put future posts on the Forum and let N3V worry about the hackers.\nIf you go into the config of your session and change the route map the session refers to than, anyone who has the CPR in any form but different grasses eg should be able to run the route/session.\nWhen you have a test for me i can proof what I say when you ready.\nI have done this dozen times when a session linked to an older CPR version I wanted to link to a newer, changed the config map kuid the session has to run on and done.\nI understand what you mean when updating Sessions but this is your own kuid on your own computer and Trainz recognises this.\nWhen I replaced the grasses I can only save it in my kuid which Trainz gives me, like it or not.\nFor instance: your map 122860:100035, after installing and saving the new grasses has now become 90608:100027, the 90608 being my kuid.\nThis is fine as long as I don't want to upload the map to anywhere. It may now be in my kuid but doesn't belong to me.\nI think the way to go is to release the Session with the default map 122860:100035. I will add an instruction on how to change the map kuid in the Session to whatever they have on their system. This will not infringe your copyright as any player must have bought your original map before they can update grasses.\nAll very complicated so I'll leave that for now until I get the Session finished.\nI'll come back to you at that time to see about testing.\ndefying 58414 little critters and bugs the Rogers Pass passed my QA tests with \"flying colors\" after crashing first time after 2 hours without any normal reason than the exisitng Trainz bug.\nThe route is now ready for dl for those interested in a 58414 1.07 version of this section.\nAbout wich trainz TS12 versions support my routes. Simple and straight forward ALL releases work 100% and dependencies of the route are all working and links for dl provided. It cannot be more simple and all in one place.If for any reason you feel well with the 49922 version dl this one from your account profile.I use the 58414 as the driver here runs particularly well, but earlier versions no problem.\nCan i ask what the file size is for the whole Route please Roy ?, Like to download the whole thing mate i am on a limited wireless service here and it would take for ever to download if the Route and Deps is too big. And does it only come in a winter version ?. Loks pretty cool the whole thing.\nsorry I just now checked the blog to see for comments that need approval. Many times hackers and sorts of try to ruin one's day and for unknown reason and sick pleasure that never works at least not with us.\nOk the size of the entire route is a cdp/zip 199 MB! not that big even for a limited internet connection and my site has fast acces so dl would work fine.\nThe deps are all grouped in smaller ones and also setup to fit as you said ltd acces internet connections.\nI am very pleased to see you around here and we would be more than happy to welcome you to our community. You will love it and yes the winter/seasonal groundtextures for a auto pre and post winter experience is included.\nCheck my thread there are somewhere also winterpictures around.\nThis should get you on the tracks with Roy's trainz.\nThanks Roy i'll certainly grab it at sum stage mate, Few other projects i want to take care of first though so thanks again.\nHate to be a pain again mate sorry but can i ask one more question, If i have not updated to the latest patchs for TS12 can i still use your Route ?. Or would i have to patch to the latest build ?. Thanks Roy.\nyes when you purchase my routes it will show you what to dowload for eg. 49922 WIN and MAC version and in case the 58414 release the coresponding CPR route working/updated for the version of TS12.\nAlso I did \"update a lot of built-in and other used cdp's to actualize them as far as feasible to run well on 58414.\nthese routes look awesome, i'm currently downloading alot of stuff for other software and will buy CPR Mountain Subdivision in a couple of hours. I hope the download includes everything needed to run the route because i'm new to Trainz12. Thank You Roy for your work of Art :) Harry from Montreal, Canada.\nyou make my birthday a complete success. thanks for the very nice comment.\nWelcome to Roys Trainz and YES there is one page containing ALL needed deps at your fingertips.\nOMG, WOW! Roy you're awesome! I just finished installing \"Rogers Pass\" and I am in shock at how beautiful the route looks in TS12. Your payware even looks better than Railworks TS2014......BRAVO!\nDo you remember if I have all the routes when I bought the $70 combo? If not, which one do I not have? Curious, thank you for all your hard work and beautiful creative things.\nThe 3 in combo means that you bought the CPR Mountain Sub from Ottertail all the way to west of Revelstoke.\nI made for a limited time 3 separate \"smaller\" routes cutting/overlapping with the huge CPR MOUNTAIN connecting them via Iportals.\nThe \"smaller 3 sep routes\" where temporarily I want to allow people to taste at \"entry\" level before deciding to go for the big one.\nSome users liked the smaller ones to run a few hours i.o. of 9 up all day.\n99% bought and uses the CPR MOUNTAIN SUB.\nI did not anticipate so much work due to several bugs in any trainz version when cutting. Imagine eg deleting a baseboard does not mean all data within and crossing is deleted and you and up with \"invisble floating elements\" ouside your cut route.\nthis morning Richard post on my trainz forum threads very touching post indeed!\n\"Hi Roy and everyone else who views this thread.\n5 days ago I had been in Trainz exile for around 4 years. If I am totally honest I didn't think I would ever take an interest in Trainz again having drifted onto other things. On Sunday afternoon I stumbled across The Kickstarter Project \"Trainz Simulator - A New Era\". Initially I made a modest pledge, I liked the idea and the more I read about it, the more my interest in the future of Trainz was growing. The fire was lit and within a few hours I was back on the Kickstarter page increasing my pledge. At this point I was going to take a back seat and strap myself in for the ride and watch the next 4 weeks unfold. It didn't stop there though, I still couldn't stop at pledge number 2. I decided I needed a bigger slice of the action and pledge number 3 was made within 24 hours of me starting all this. Having got this far and making a commitment to the future of Trainz it was time to dust down my last version of the game Trainz 2009 and take a look. I had remembered fondly how much I enjoyed Trainz 2004 and Trainz 2006 along with Trainz classics, although if I am honest winding the clock back 4 years and looking at Trainz 2009 did little to enhance my new found enthusiasm for the Trainz Kickstarter project.\nTaking the above into consideration it was time to research the current version of trainz and try and establish what the best available routes for Trainz 12 were. This is where I stumbled across Roys Trainz and after browsing his site and the forums I knew instantly I wasn't going to wait for my Get Trainz Now selection from the Kickstarter Pledge. I bought Trainz 12 along with CPR-Mountain-Sub TS14 and It's one of the best decisions I have ever made.\nThe Route is absolutely stunning Roy and is a credit to you.\nI look forward to seeing your work hit new heights in future versions of trains.\nain't that something wow feels good and gives lots of energy.\nThe day after Dec.17th we all feel much better KS first step reached and more streched goals will make it for sure.\nThanks all the trainzers who supported vie my website and of course all those that pledged on the official KS and trainz website!!!\nFor those new to my website asking how come this blog is not very active, the reason is simple we use the main Trainz forum my trheads and thus reach at the same time other trainzers not part (yet) of the Roy's Trainz family.\nIf you like to share on my threads that you pledged also thru my routes please post over there and here of course.\nI respect eachothers privacy and not publish a list.\nHappy Holidays and Happy New Trainz year and 2014!\nwilliam asked me today in an email if my routes work on TS 12 he bought from steam.\nYes all my routes work on TS12 and all versions, see on this website when you click more on the CPR Mountain Sub it show TS12 version number and windows and or MAC version number.\nWell, finally we did it the Laggan sub section West is ready to download.\nfurther posts and comments we do as usual on the trainz forum in my threads Canadian rocky Mountains 2011 and others i opened there.\n\"I just downloaded the Columbia River Basin and it is the most amazing, most detailed route in trainz! It took me in a CP ES44AC running at track speed almost 3 hours to get done! of course I met 2 trains along the way and had to follow a northbound CN grain, but it was amazing! Super fun, super realistic, and totally worth the $25! Every person that has trainz 12 download this now!!!!\"\nMid summer for most on this globe activity still high on roystrainz!! Most users know this blog is kind of sleepy as most activity blog etc is on trainz forum so please follow up over there to avoid double traffic.\nAt this moment i try to solve a mysterious bug on a beautiful very intelligent way of session automated traffic for CPR Mountain Sub created by my good dutch fellow friend Henk. His sessions works flawless on his computers but mine seem to love to bug a few AI trains so this and next week i will try to re-create his work from scratch and will keep you guys updated on the results. In case you are interested in the results email me or post on my threads on trainz forum.\nWell we did it and cleared all winter tracks into Ottertail and further to Viktor Lake. Now ready for download is the all NEW CPR MOUNTAIN SUB SEASONAL with 4 seasons and much more and yes for future TANE use ready to migrate to that level when they are ready. In the mean time you can enjoy this gem the fullest in TS12 and maybe appreciate more now that TS12 with the so many shortcomings still is a nice piece of sim. It is sad to say how people ravage over TANE CE a not finished product (never should be released) as most trainzer have no clue what it takes to get a finished product until the final day of official release.\nSo i released yesterday some 300 plus seasonal assets. you will find them on the download page when you have bought the CPR Mountain Sub 1.0.9 look for the route 1.0.9 seasonal.\nStill some more to do but that is for later now finish the TANE speedtrees first release for my routes.\nWell at least the curtain starts moving in the TANE 3D theatre announcing wazz up and coming \"soon\". Yes they start with the Columbia River Basin followed by all the other one's all new routes so much bigger,wider,more details than ever before and much much more to come all in super realistic mode and not to forget protypical!!\nOnce all routes in TANe are out there the TS12 routes will fade out slowly and close an era we all enjoyed so much. You can post here but I prefer you do on my Canadian Rocky Mountains thread in the trainz frorum. A little bit more patience to iron out little critters and cracks by the N3V crew. they have a mountain of routes from me to get ready so give them credit and energy to get things done the soonest and well.\nGlad Roy is still up and kickin'!!!"}

{"doc_id": "419", "text": "A mattress for side sleepers? What about a mattress for back or stomach sleepers? Why is there a mattress designed specifically for side sleepers? The mattress must meet the unique needs that a side sleeper needs. The mattress should have a good temperature control so the person can sleep comfortably. The mattress should be reasonably priced and specifically designed for people who like to habitually sleep on their sides. The mattress must give this type of sleeper strong support for their backs, necks and legs, and feet. If the person likes to bend their legs while they sleep or they like to sleep with their legs straight the mattress must be able to meet these needs. This is why memory foam would be good to have so it will form to the person\u2019s peculiar sleeping position.\nBenefits and Uses: The mattress is supposed to have 3.5 gel memory foam that conforms to your body. It Will keep the spine aligned and prevent tossing and turning during the night. It does not allow for motion transfer and it will help you have a great night\u2019s sleep. It is lined with New Zealand wool which absorbs moisture and controls the temperature. It will also stop odor from absorbing into the mattress. It contains no harsh chemicals or chemicals that are flame retardant. The mattress is great for side sleepers and the company offers a limited 25 year limited warranty. The mattress is rolled up and compressed into the box for easy shipping.\nFeedback: The mattress had over 2200 review written about it. The customer has rheumatoid arthritis and says she can sleep on the sorest parts of her body and she has no pain. The pressure points are fine and she woke up at 7:30 in the morning and she felt like she had slept until 11:00 a.m. She was afraid to sleep on memory foam but she now has no reservations about it.\nThe customer said they researched the product thoroughly and decided to buy this memory foam mattress. He had tried several other memory foam mattresses in the past. He ordered the product and it was delivered to the front door. The customer was told the box weighed 102 lbs. and the customer was impressed with how compact the mattress was in the box. He dragged the box to the bed the mattress was to go on. He took it out of the box and he let the mattress air out for s night. He slept in another room and the next night he slept on the new mattress. He slept fine until 3:00 am and then he woke up with the sweats. He slept off and on until the morning. He slept on the mattress the next night but he put a fan near the mattress to cool it down. The fan got the room to cool so he had to set the fan at a higher speed. He developed an acute tailbone lower backache. He could not afford this injury because he does heavy lifting at his work. He decided to return the product so he contacted Amazon. The rep said since the mattress had human contact that Amazon could not return the product. The rep said his credit card would be fully reimbursed. He could not believe Amazon would give the money back without taking the mattress back. Amazon told him to give the mattress away. The customer rated the product 2-stars. You cannot blame him for giving the product such a low-rating.\nThe customer says this is the best mattress he has ever had except for a very expensive one his ex got to keep. This mattress did not sink in the middle or lose his form. He has had very good nights of sleep on the mattress and he gave it a 5-star rating. He highly recommends the product. This is a great mattress for the price. the customer says they have the mattress for a month and so far so good. The mattress is firm and the client likes to sleep on firm mattresses.\nThe customer is disabled and cannot go to the store to try out a mattress to see what it is really like before he would buy it. He tried this mattress and was disgusted with it because it was not firm at all. He showed a picture of himself sitting on the mattress. It sagged a good 6 to 8 inches when the mattress was 13 inches high. It is definitely not a firm mattress. The customer is tired of reading reviews that do not meet his expectations concerning the product. He thinks maybe the reviews are fake because they seem to be wrong most of the time. Being a disabled person he really needs the reviews to accurately reflect the quality of the product. He called Amazon and they said to give the mattress away but we will still fully refund your money. He likes the way Amazon takes care of the customers. The customer rated the product one-star.\nThe couple bought the mattress 3 years ago and they are disgusted with the product. They slept well on it at first but now they wake up in the morning with aches and pains. The mattress sagged in certain spots making it tougher to sleep. The rotated the mattress to try and alleviate the sags it did not work. They could not flip the mattress over because the thickness on the bottom is different than on the top. The customer said this mattress is only 3-years-old and is a lousy product. The customers rated the product 2-stars. The mattress was a solid mattress and it was easy to set up. The wife and husband were people of average weight so they cannot understand why the mattress would sag. They will not buy the product again and they do not recommend the product.\nBenefits and Uses: It is a knitted polyester and tencel blended fabric which will relieve tension on your shoulders and hips. The mattress is great for side sleepers and is so soft you will think you\u2019re sleeping in the clouds. The mattresses 4 layers will have you sleeping in optimal comfort. The top panel supplies you with comfort. The memory gel section alleviates pressure and gives you support while you sleep. The internal breathable layer keeps you cool while you sleep. The foundational layer comes in soft, medium, and firm designations. You order what you want. The mattress comes with a 10-year non-prorated warranty and a 120 night comfort guarantee.\nFeedback: The customer said the mattress came in 18 inches and 41 inches square. It came in a heavy plastic shipping bag and it was easy to roll out of the bag. The customer put it on the mattress box and they waited two hours to sleep on the mattress. Contrary to what they had read and heard the mattress had no odor. The customer said they slept well on the mattress and that it was a foam mattress and not a memory mattress. The customer is right it is not a memory mattress but a foam mattress. The customer does not want a memory mattress. The customer rated the product 5-stars.\nThe customer rated the product 5-stars and said it was very easy to set up. The product is very comfortable and this is all the customer writes. This is not a detailed review and tells us nothing about the quality of the product. Why is it great? Is it firm? Is it soft? The customer does not say why they rated the product 5-stars. The customer does not write if they slept soundly during the night or that they woke up refreshed in the morning. We do not know if the customer woke up in pain or if any previous pains were alleviated. This review has no selling value for future customers. The review is too general and neutral to convince anyone to buy or not to buy the product.\nThis is not a very positive review because the customer rated the product 3-stars. Which really is an average rating. The customer bought a medium and firm mattress. The couple decided to sleep on the firm mattress and put the medium mattress in the guest room. The wife has had back issues for years and needed the firm support. The husband weighs 200 lbs and needs to find a comfortable position to sleep in. The firm mattress met this requirement. Despite this seemingly positive review, the customer rated the product 3-stars which sends strong mixed signals. The review will not convince people to buy the product.\nThe customer says the mattress is like sleeping on a cloud as they said in their own words. They tried the mattress in the store and the longer they laid on it the better they liked it. They selected the firm mattress and they have rated the product 5-stars. They wrote the review the day this article was written 7/16/2018. So, it remains to be seen what the customer thinks about the product down the road.\nThe customer pays the mattress was easy to set up and is comfortable to sleep on but they did not say why it was easy to set up or why it was so comfortable for them to lay on. The customer rated the product 5-stars. Two women wrestled the box mattress upstairs without any extra help. They said once you get it out the box take it right to where it will be slept on. This is because the mattress once it comes out of the box it expands rapidly so you do not have a lot of time to move the mattress. They put it in the guest room but quickly moved it to the master bedroom because it was too good to leave in the guest room. The mattress is nice and the customer rated the product 5-stars.\nBenefits and Uses: Hopefully the mattress is worthy of the robust price tag it carries-$3599 which is very expensive. The mattress is 11.8 inches thick and it is made of temperature material. Or it will control the temperature as you sleep giving you a comfortable sleep. It helps to spread the body weight evenly across the bed helping you to sleep without waking up sore in the morning. The cover is made of breathable, cooling material that keeps the surface of the mattress cool. The mattress material is designed with cooling benefits and it draws heat from the body.\nFeedback: The customer says the mattress is working very well for them. They use to lay down and could not sleep and on top of it they would wake up sore. Now, with this mattress as soon as they lay down they fall asleep. They wake up in the morning without feeling sore. They would wake up every morning sore when they slept on the other mattress. The client rated it 5-stars. The customer says they wanted to wait before they wrote this review and the finally got around to writing the review. They wanted to sleep on the bed for awhile before making a report and they wrote their report. The customer said they always thought they would sleep on a coil mattress but they bought this one instead.\nBenefits and Uses: The mattress is designed to controls the temperature while you sleep and the memory gel contours to the body for a top night of sleep. 2 inches of memory foam sit on 8 inches of density foam with a soft foam cover. Like so many other mattresses the gel foam draws heat away from the body.\nFeedback: The customer at first did not like the mattress because it gave her a \u201csinking\u201d feeling. She sank in the mattress and it felt mushy. She called the rep and the rep said they would send a firmer mattress. But after 3 days the mattress became firmer and the customer fell in love with the mattress and canceled the order for a firmer mattress. The customer kept the medium mattress and she is sleeping very comfortably. Her husband loves the mattress as well and the customer is not waking up hot and sweaty during the night. The customer has rated the mattress 5-stars.\nThe customer has been using the mattress for quite awhile and it is just as supportive as it was on day one. The twin mattresses are working wonderfully for the customer and the bed doubles as a daybed and a night bed. The customer flips the mattress around but due to construction, the mattress cannot be flipped over. The customer weighs 140 pounds so keep this in mind as you read the review. If you are heavier than this customer\u2019s 140 lbs the bed may not work for you. The Customer says the mattress is as good as some mattresses that may cost a lot more than this one. The customer would buy the mattress again. The customer expects the mattress to last for years. The customer rated the product 5-stars.\nThe customer bought this mattress to replace a $1200 dollar mattress the client owned before. This mattress is as good as that $1200.00 dollar mattress. The mattress was easy to set up and the customer is the mattress is working very well. The customer sleeps peacefully every night on the mattress. The customer says it is worth 5-stars and will update in the future if any problems arise. The customer said the odor from the mattress dissipated quickly and the customer was glad about this.\nBenefits and Uses: The mattress has 2.5 inches of gel material on the top with 8.5 inches of deluxe base material. Supposedly the mattress brings a top luxury hotel feel to the home according to the company. The company claims that 90% of the reviews rated the mattress 5-stars. The mattress is able to relieve pressure points which prevents you from tossing and turning all night. The product will relieve shoulder, back and hip pain. The mattress is supposed to give you a delightful night of sleep.\nFeedback: The company did not tell the truth they said 90% of the reviews were 5-stars. There were 77% of the reviews that rated the product 5-stars. Oh, this is great because the customer receives the mattress and the customer opens the box and finds some of the seams on the mattress were ripping on a brand-new mattress. The delivery guy will not take the mattress back because it is opened. The customer needs to return the mattress. What are they supposed to do now? It sure seems like the company cannot be trusted because they lied about how many 5-star reviews they received for the product and now this customer receives a new mattress that has seams ripping.\nWe have taken a look at some mattresses that will help you if you are a side sleeper and they will help you sleep comfortably with no aches or pains when you wake up in the morning. One downside in the reviews is one of the company\u2019s lied about how many 5-stars reviewed they received for their mattress. It would be to a customer\u2019s advantage to avoid this company. You will see which company it is in the review list above."}

I'm looking forward to read it!!.\nI hope your book will arrive soon too!!!\nLeft the book in Switserland with a friend who wanted to read it too. After she's finished with it, the book will come back to me so I can read it myself.\nHave fun reading it, Irene!!\nSo, E-mile, the book comes back to you in Holland and thanks again!\nFran is back!!!! My friend from Switserland send me the book back; so now I can read it myself. She realy liked it, so I'm even more eager to read it than I already was!!!\nI just loved the book!!!!!\nFran tells her story with such humor.\ngood reading material it is.\nAgain thanks for the book, FamFatale!!\nAnd there was interest for a bookring! Today Fran will go to the first person in the ring: Arja.\nHave a safe and wonderful journey, Fran!!!\nE-mile mentioned this book and I thought it'd be interesting to read more about Fran's life. Might take a few weeks, as I suddenly had a pile of ring books arrive at the same time.\nI never realized how many other shows and films Fran Drescher must have worked on, before and during The Nanny. Also, I had not expected her to be so obnoxious and eccentric all the time in her behaviour and writing. IMHO this gets a bit annoying, even though that is who she is (or how she wants to present herself).\nE-mile, can you please tell me who to send the book to next?\nGister in de brievenbus gekregen via Arja. Hartelijk bedankt voor het langsbrengen. Ben er meteen in begonnen, was speciaal even in niets nieuws begonnen omdat ik wist dat ie eraan zat te komen. Ben benieuwd. Leuk dat het boek helemaal uit de US komt!\nWhat a lovely book to read and nice photo's too! Very funny. A real feel-good-story as far as I'm concerned, really liked it.\nShe sounds gratefull for the carrier she has and doesn't take her success for granted. I'll enjoy the episodes of The Nanny even more now I know the whole history and details behind it!\nI will bring the book to Tiekie this week asap.\nGot this book today from Pietenpadje. I am very looking forward to reading this book, so I will move my other books to a dark place and settle down tonight! Thank you E-mile for this lovely ring-book!!\nI am sending this book to the next person on the list. I have got no time to read it and I don't want to keep it here for too long.\nFran arrived on my doormat today!\nI'm really looking forward to reading this book.\nThanks for sending it Tiekie, and perhaps you can still read it after me?\nBy the way, nice to know that this book comes all the way from America!\nFinished it and what a fun book to read!\nAt times I really had to laugh out loud. And it's really written in her voice, literally... you actually hear her saying all these sentences!\nThe only thing that was nagging me whilst reading the book was the way she talked about her husband and her wonderful marriage... soon after this book was published they got divorced!!\nMaybe she wrote about that in her second book? I guess I have to read that as well!\nI'll contact Tiekie to ask if she has time to read it now, otherwise this book will be off to muizz.\nFran is on her way to Muizz!\nSorry for the late journal entry. I found the parcel in a stack of mail when I came home from a couple of days abroad and then I forgot to register it. Luckily Mirre sent me a reminder that she hadn't heard wether the book has arrived. Well, it has! Probably it will take some time before I am able to read it, because there are some other books screaming for attention as well.\nThanks for ringing the book, and Mirre, thanks for sending the book and for the reminder.\nImagine you are at a dinner party and the woman sitting next to you doesn't stop talking. She keeps on talking about her career, clothes, celebrities she's met, clothes, her succesful television show, clothes, her apearance at David Letterman shows and how funny she was there, clothes, etc. You don't want to be impolite and you make some encouraging noises, and in the mean time you are looking for a place to hide.\nThat's how I felt when reading this book. Normally I love (auto)biographies, but this one I didn't enjoy. Someone who is able to spend 6 pages about the preparations for a photo shoot (how her make up, hair and clothes were) can't keep my interest. I'm really sorry. Needless to say that I didn't finish this book.\nNow the book will continue its journey. It'll go to Sarana.\nWhat a lovely and funny book! I've read it while spending the Easter weekend with my parents and I kept calling out to them \"Ooo, did you know that...\" and \"You've got to hear this...\". I had no idea that so much about The Nanny was based on Fran's own life. I loved her stories, especially the down-to-earth-ness of them, and the fact that she wasn't afraid to tell her silliest stories or show her most unflattering pictures... A very sympathetic woman, as far as you can tell through this book.\nI'm shocked to read in Mirre's Journal Entry that she's divorced now, the way she describes her marriage it's hard to believe that it fell apart soon afterwards!\nThanks for ringing the book, E-mile! I'm PM'ing Nandaaah now.\nEdit: I'm terribly sorry for the long delay, the book was mailed out today.\nAnd the book has arrived, just started in another, so I'll probably start in this book somewhere in the next week.\nI've finished the book today in the hot sun. It was an O.K. book to read.\nJust as Arja, I didn't know she did this many other shows and films. And too bad she divorced, since her mariage seems good in the book, but unexpecting things can happen. The book will be off to the next reader as soon as I got an adress to send it to.\nAnd I got the book now! Thanx Nandaaah for sending it and E-mile for ringing (?) it. I allready started in it because my last book was just finished. Fun to know that her parents and sister's names in the Nanny came out off real life. That Chester was her dog, I knew allready. I will try to finish it before the Castricum-meeting.\nGelukt! Geweldig van genoten! En nu The Nanny weer op tv is kijk ik toch met *iets* andere ogen. Bedankt voor het ringen E-mile. Ze komt morgen bij je terug.\n\"What I learned about myself, the depth of my relationships, and cancer -tests, treatment, recovery and follow-up- could fill a book. So here it is.\n* back to E-mile. <-- Fran is back home!!!!\nposted Fran today, so the ring can continue..\nFran has arrived in Gouda! I'm looking forward to reading this book and am pleased to see it has pictures in it! Is has been a while since I read a book containing pictures.\nHi guys, perhaps you already know it, but since a few weeks there is another comedy on RTL4 on sunday afternoon with/about Fran!! I saw it for the first time last sunday and wanted to let you know that it's out there.\nNa 'The Nanny' is Fran Drescher terug met een nieuwe komedie. In 'Living with Fran' is Fran een gescheiden vrouw die geniet van de nieuwe weg die haar leven is ingeslagen. Haar nieuwe liefde Riley is fantastisch, geweldig en jong, heel erg jong. Hun relatie is ingewikkeld vanwege het feit dat de kinderen van Fran bijna even oud zijn als hun nieuwe 'stiefvader'. Het nieuwe huishouden van Fran mag dan niet traditioneel zijn en soms heel lastig, toch weet ze zeker dat ze het niet anders zou willen doen.\n'Living with Fran', vanaf zondag 11 juni, 17.00 - 17.30 uur, RTL 4.\nToday Fran arrived at my doormat, together with 2(!) other books...Which makes the count of ringbooks that arrived here in 3 days: 7...I think I'll need to ask my boss for a reading leave-of-absense.\nAnyway, although not all the stories were equally entertaining I enjoyed reading the book. It was really written in her voice, like Mirre said!\nI can't wait to read the other book!\nThanks for re-opening the ring E-mile!\nI'll send it to Yinny asap!\nFound it in the mailbox yesterday!\nThank you, E-mile for sharing this book and Enitnaj for sending this book!\nYes, she is boasting about all the famous people she met, the people she knows, the clothes she wears, blablabla. But she does it so innocently, so charming, that it isn't (very) annoying.\nThis book is already on its way to the next reader.\nThe book is here! I'll start reading it right away, because the book I'm currently reading is not to my taste.\nThe book is badly damaged, I'll try to repair some of it.\nI never watched the Nanny because I dislike sitcoms and canned laughter, but this book was neat. Miss Drecher sure has a lot of energy!\nThanks for the sweet card you left me in the book Yinny! I'll keep using it as a bookmark.\nI'm mailing this book to Redfloor today. Happy reading!\nLag in mijn brievenbus. Ben heel erg benieuwd ernaar. Er zijn nog wel enkele boeken die eerst aan de beurt zijn. Dutch-flybabe, je hebt het keurig gerestaureerd! Dank ook voor de kaart.\nEdit: Ere wie ere toekomt, Dutch-flybabe heeft het boekje gerestaureerd, niet Yinny.\nWat een leuk boek om te lezen. Allereerst door het formaat. Het is een lekker kleine pocket met kleine letters. Het paste makkelijk in mijn tas, zelfs als deze al vol zat. Daardoor kon ik doorlezen in de trein. Alle boeken zouden in dit formaat verkrijgbaar moeten zijn.\nDaarnaast is het ook gewoon heel erg leuk om te lezen over het leven van een van mijn favoriete actrices. Heel grappig om te lezen dat haar eigen ouders ook Sylvia en Morty heten en dat er meer parallellen zijn. Fijn dat Fran uiteindelijk een succesvolle carriere heeft. Ik bekijk de Nanny nu met heel andere ogen. Ik ben benieuwd naar deel twee, al vermoed ik, gezien de inhoud, dat dat deel lang niet zo hilarisch zal zijn.\nHaven't read it yet but will so very soon. Thanx for sending it Redfloor!\nFran is on her way to Jordanne. Have fun!!\nI found it in my mailbox a few days ago! I think it'll be a quick read!\nThanks for ringing and sending it to me!\nOp de post naar de volgende lezer!\nHeb dit boek voordat ik op vakantie ging uitgelezen. Opzich leuk om te weten hoe de serie The Nanny er is gekomen en dat veel is gebaseerd op haar eigen ervaringen, maar dat idee van 'aan je hoofd zeuren' kreeg ik ook wel. Ik had het idee dat ik een verlengde versie van een verhaal over een ster in de Story of de Prive zat te lezen, eerlijk gezegd.\nHet boek is vandaag aangekomen.\nHet ziet er leuk uit, veel foto's.\nIk ga er gelijk in beginnen, was gisteren klaar met mijn vorige ringboek.\nDank je wel voor het opsturen en ringen!\ni received the book today.\nIt looks like a fun and nice book, i like the photo's in it.\nI am going to read it right now.\nThanks for sending it to me and thanks for this ring!\nInteressant boek om te lezen, het word ook wel makkelijk gemaakt met de foto's die erin zitten van haar leven.\nWat het gelijk ook weer leuker maakt om te lezen.\nIt is an intersting book to read.\nAlso to see the photo's that are inside the book.\nErg leuk om te lezen!! Leuke foto's, leuke manier van schrijven!!\nAnd Fran found her way back home again! Thanks for sending it, Bontekever! (btw: did you read the book? I haven't seen a journal entry of it....)."}

{"doc_id": "425", "text": "In the second book of the Harry Potter Series, \u201cThe Chamber of Secrets\u201d by J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter finds out that he can communicate with snakes using the Parseltongue language.\nIn this challenge we will write a Python script to translate English to Parseltongue and vice-versa.\nTo encode a message into Parseltongue you need to insert the string sequence \u201csss\u201d between each character of your message. e.g.\nI can speak to snakes using Parseltongue.\nTo decode a message from Parseltongue remove the \u201csss\u201d character sequences by only keeping 1 character out of 4 from the encoded message.\nCheck the following code, which uses two subroutines (functions) called encode() and decode() to encode a message in Parseltongue or decode a message from Parseltongue. Both functions use a technique called string concatenation to add one letter at a time to the message or cypher being generated.\nDid you know? Encoding and decoding secret messages is a key application of Computer Science called cryptography. An encoded message is called a cipher.\nAs a wizard at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry, Harry Potter often needs to decipher secret messages. In this set of challenges you will write Python subroutines to encode or decode secret messages using a range of techniques.\nThe Parseltongue coding technique described above is not very secure. It would be easy for anyone to look at a cipher text and to be able to find a way to decipher it without being told how to in the first instance.\nTo make this encryption technique more secure we will adapt the encode() function implemented in the trinket above. Instead of adding the string \u201csss\u201d after each character we will add three random letters.\nBy completing this challenge, we are going to learn how to use ASCII code when manipulating strings.\nYou will use the chr() and ord() python instructions to convert characters into ASCII code and vice versa.\nprint(chr(97)) would display the letter \u201ca\u201d on screen as 97 is the ASCII code for character \u201ca\u201d.\nprint(ord(\u201ca\u201d)) would display the 97 on screen as 97 is the ASCII code for character \u201ca\u201d.\nUse this code to tweak the the encode() function. The decode() function should not need to be updated and should still work with this new encryption technique.\nTest your code. Do you find the cipher text to be more secure?\nUsing this encryption techniques the cipher message is based on the actual message with the letters of the message appearing in reverse order. e.g.\nUsing this encryption technique, the same function can be used to both encode and decode a message.\nYour task is to implement one function used to encode/decode a message, applying the \u201cReversi formula\u201d.\nCreate two new functions to encode and decode two messages at the same time by intertwining each letter of these messages. Your encode() function will take two parameters, message1 and message2, and generate a cipher by intertwining each letter of both messages, one letter at a time.\nIn cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as shift cipher, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the message to encrypt is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.\nYou will find out more about this technique by following this link.\nCan you think of any other approach you could use to encrypt a message? You may combine several of the techniques listed above, as combining several techniques will make your cipher more difficult to decode hence it will be a lot more secure!"}
{"doc_id": "426", "text": "The city of Augusta is located in Georgia near the state's border with South Carolina. It plays host to the Masters Tournament, the most lauded tournament in professional golf. Augusta is known for the Masters, but there are several other fascinating sides to this city. Here are five things you never knew about Augusta, home of the Masters.\nAugusta was Georgia\u2019s capital briefly during the American Revolution and then again from 1785 until 1795. In 1788, the Georgia state convention ratified the U.S. Constitution in the city. Georgia was the fourth state to ratify the Constitution and the first in the Deep South. Augusta wasn\u2019t chartered as a city until 1798, so it was actually Georgia\u2019s capital city before officially becoming a city itself.\nPresident Woodrow Wilson, who was in office from 1913 to 1921, was born in Virginia but grew up in Augusta. Born in 1856, Wilson lived in Augusta from 1858 to 1870. His father was the pastor of Augusta\u2019s First Presbyterian Church and his family owned a beautiful manse on Seventh Street. Wilson spent the \u201cformative years of his life\u201d in the city. He lived in Augusta during the Civil War and the Reconstruction before going to college in North Carolina. Today, you can visit his boyhood home, which is a National Historic Landmark and the oldest Presidential residence in the state. Guided tours begin on the hour every Thursday through Saturday.\nAugusta has been either the hometown or burial place of 10 Confederate generals \u2014 Brig. Gen. Edward P. Alexander, Maj. Gen. Ambrose R. Wright and Gen. Marcellus A. Stovall, among others. \u201cWhen the South needed generals during the Civil War, it often turned to Augustans,\u201d the Augusta Chronicle says. Today, you can see monuments all over the city that have been dedicated to these men.\nThe Masters wasn\u2019t always called the Masters; the title didn\u2019t come about until 1939. The tournament began in 1934 and was originally known as the Augusta National Invitational. That name didn\u2019t sound quite prestigious enough, however \u2014 so in 1939, the name was changed to the Masters.\nThe first-in-flight brothers from North Carolina brought their airplanes to Georgia. The Wright Flying School was in business from 1910 to 1916. During that time, it taught 119 people to fly Wright airplanes. The main location of the school was in Alabama and then moved to Ohio. Trying to take advantage of the warm winters in the South, the Wrights also opened a seasonal facility in Augusta in 1911. It was run by Frank Coffyn, an aviator who was a member of the Wright Exhibition Team after the Wright brothers taught him to fly."}
{"doc_id": "427", "text": "Sometimes it is the things you see every day which inspire you. A colour or texture catches your eye, and you're hooked. The itch starts, and you find you have to paint it. Whatever it might be. This happened for me a couple of years ago, when I was working with the lovely Vital Veg at Midmar. Every week I packed beautiful, colourful veg into veg bags for customers. Some of the veg came home with me. And some of that came with me to the weekly art class I was attending.\nAnother influence fed into this process. A few years ago, I attended a workshop with Sofia Perina-Miller, whose work I also greatly admire. She paints fabulous striking flowers, as well as many other subjects. She showed us how to paint directly onto paper, without doing any initial drawing. This was an entirely new experience for me - and I found that I loved the freedom of it! Instead of feeling constrained by the pencil lines, I was \"free\" to paint directly, loosely, using vibrant colours, which resulted in more lively work. Sofia usually adds meticulous pen and ink details to her work. I left mine as they were; as I may have mentioned before I have rather limited patience!\nThere is always a certain amount of fear involved in painting this way. I had to learn to be brave, to trust that the colours I was choosing and the marks I was making were strong and true and confident. This was no time for fiddling around with details and tentative marks. Before I started, I would look carefully at the veg, get a feel for the overall shape and size and proportions, the main colours, the shadows on the paper. Really look, and get a feel for it. It helped to stand up, to have everything I needed to hand and to just do it, quickly. I love this way of working; writing this makes me want to do some more of this kind of work.\nSome of my veg paintings are available as digital downloads from my Etsy shop.\nVarious items (prints, mugs, phone covers, tote bags etc.) sporting my veg paintings can also be found on Redbubble.\nI often make soup. At the organic veg farm where I work part-time, we take it in turns to bring a pot of soup to the veg shed on the day we pack veg bags for customers. One of the things I love about soup is that it is very forgiving. You can throw just about anything into it and it is usually pretty tasty and good. (The only exception seems to be kiwi fruit, which a friend reminded me of today - that did not turn out well. I do quite often put apple or pear in soup though, lends a lovely sweetness). Most of us who takes turns with the soup pot admit to making \"bottom of the fridge\" soup, with whatever is left and is maybe looking a little tired. Some celery, onion, a courgette, a bit of broccoli, the odd kale leaf and some carrots - add ham stock, a tin of chopped tomatoes and hey presto, it's minestrone! Minestrone is one of my favourites and yet I don't recall having it at home when I was a child. We had broth (not a favourite; I disliked the gloopy texture of the barley), and homemade tomato soup with lots of carrots and was it sago, perhaps, to thicken it? My favourite was cucumber soup, creamy and buttery and delicious. My dad loved consomme, hot or cold (brown meaty jelly with chopped chives on top). We had chicken soup too, made using a boiling fowl, with rice and leeks and chopped parsley from the garden to garnish it. We used to laugh at Mum, who would make soup from the peapods after the sweet garden peas had been shelled from them. \"Is that grass soup?\" we would ask. I quite often produce \"green soup\" of slightly dubious origins myself, these days, so I can now appreciate the greenness of her ways.\nIt's a real comfort food. And not just the eating of it, or supping of it, but the act of making it. I remember retreating to the kitchen of my mother-in-law's house the day after my father-in-law died very suddenly, over 25 years ago now. We went to stay with her, with our six month old son. To try to help; to organise the funeral, make endless cups of tea for people who came in to offer condolences; to try and make sense of it all. All I could do was make soup. I chopped and stirred and added stock. I left it to simmer, tasted it, ladled it into bowls for whoever wanted some. It seemed to help. It helped me, to feel I was providing comfort, of sorts. I think I maybe even baked. There was comfort in it for me too. Just the rhythm of washing and peeling and chopping, stirring and tasting and serving. Life going on, in some small way."}

{"doc_id": "429", "text": "In China, the prevalence of tooth decay among 12-year-olds increased nearly 35 percent from 2005 to 2015. While most parents still believe that good dental hygiene means brushing teeth twice a day, dental professionals suggest that neglecting timely oral care after meals contributes to the problem. Wrigley\u2019s Extra Sugar-Free Gum wanted to inspire Chinese parents to encourage their children to chew sugar-free gum after meals, which can help prevent tooth decay and improve oral health.\nWe tapped into Chinese school children\u2019s daily lunch routines and created the first interactive lunchbox that encourages children to practice oral hygiene after meals \u2014 Extra Care Box. The care box used artwork that playfully changes with heat and reveals cartoon characters who work together to clean their teeth. This fun activation captures children\u2019s attention and encourages them to open a built-in compartment and chew the sugar-free gum inside it after meals, a simple reminder that helps improve their daily oral hygiene \u2014 without interrupting their playtime."}

They wanted a better future for their family, so they moved from Central America to the U.S. to find it.\nDuring that period, her parents were back and forth between the countries, and Lesbia rarely saw them. Six years later, she finally joined them on American soil.\nWhen she started school, Lesbia couldn\u2019t speak English. Other kids made fun of her name. She struggled.\nBut eventually, she learned to stop caring what other people thought. She realized that this new country held a wealth of opportunities.\nAs time went on and they worked to adjust to the U.S., other members of Lesbia\u2019s family found Hispanic Unity of Florida (HUF). They referred her, and after obtaining a work permit, she was able to get temporary child care assistance at HUF.\nHUF changed Lesbia\u2019s life. She was supported by multiple HUF programs, including Income Support, Financial Literacy, and the Bridge Program, where she completed the Customer Service and Sales Training, as well as the Patient Care Technician EKG/Phlebotomy Training. She\u2019s currently finishing a class in math at Sheridan Technical School, and has a bright future.\nThanks to HUF, Lesbia\u2019s family will no longer live paycheck to paycheck, and she, her husband, and her children will live better lives.\nThe Bridge Program at Hispanic Unity opens up a world of opportunities! With the generous support of @Citi Foundation and the Community #ProgressMakers grant, program participants have access to tuition assistance for career pathways in high demand fields, including national certifications in Patient Care Technician (PCT) and Customer Service and Sales Training (CSST).\nThanks to @Citi Foundation #ProgressMakers, Marisol makes her dream a reality!\nFrom Boston, to Puerto Rico, to Miami, Marisol has been following her American dream since birth.\nBorn in Boston, she spent several years in the historic city before her family relocated to Puerto Rico, where she grew up and attended school.\nAs an adult, Marisol made the difficult decision to move to Florida in search of a better future for her family. She sought more safety and security. Marisol was excited and deeply committed to grow and thrive in her new home!\nStarting fresh presented numerous challenges, however. She struggled to find work while caring for her two beloved children.\nLuckily, Marisol found Hispanic Unity of Florida. Her brother had participated in HUF\u2019s Center for Working Families program and referred her.\nMarisol took the many opportunities offered by HUF and ran with them. She received income support through gift cards, child care assistance, hurricane relief help, and affordable housing. She also entered the Bridge Program where she became certified through HUF\u2019s Customer Service and Sales Representative (CSR) training.\nShortly thereafter, she was able to secure part-time employment. Marisol says that the training helped her be more in touch with clients and better understand their needs.\nThe hard-working mother wanted to take things further and thrive in a new career, so she completed HUF\u2019s Patient Care Technician Program (PCT) at Sheridan Technical College \u2013 a highly specialized training with a focus on EKG and Phlebotomy.\nCountless new opportunities are now available to Marisol, and she plans to move on into the Licensed Practical Nursing (LPN) Program. Eventually, she\u2019ll work in a private practice, and she credits HUF for helping her to empower herself and help ensure her family\u2019s successful future.\nThe Urban Institute recently released a research report titled Upskilling the Immigrant Workforce to Meet Employer Demand for Skilled Workers.\nThe report takes a look at the whole US but supplements its findings through site visits and interviews with a variety of stakeholders in three metro areas, Seattle, Dallas and Miami-Fort Lauderdale.\nHispanic Unity of Florida (HUF) participated in the study and shared with the researchers our own insights into the work we do assisting immigrants who are both unemployed as well as, underemployed.\nHow many of us know that Broward County\u2019s percentage of foreign-born residents is nearly 33% \u2013 or 3 out every 10 residents?\nThe implications are significant for our community. Our immigrant population is mostly first generation. And the needs of this population are different then communities where the immigrants are second or third generation or where the immigrants are English literate and highly educated.\nLocal communities with large foreign born residents must invest in foundational resources to assist these immigrants in their integration \u2013 which in turn \u2013 benefits the whole community.\nAt HUF where we serve immigrants from 30 different nations, our work is focused on English language instruction, education (for both parents and children), economic development (employment, small business creation, asset building, health and child care supports) and civic engagement.\nThis from the research report: This diversity within the immigrant workforce\u2014with high numbers at both ends of the educational spectrum\u2014is important context for our focus in this report on opportunities for immigrants employed in lower- and middle-skilled jobs.\nAt HUF, we simultaneously work with former professionals such as doctors, dentists, lawyers, etc. as well as individuals who never completed high school. This diversity within the immigrant community requires different approaches to the work community organizations such as HUF undertakes. For us, it means providing core services that are fundamental to all clients while providing \u201cadd-ons\u201d such as information on how to have educational credentials certified for immigrants with college or advanced degrees.\n\u201cOne out of every six workers in the US are immigrants.\u201d The research report\u2019s conclusions offers guidance for all our community\u2019s stakeholders: state and local policy makers, workforce development service providers, funders and employers. Woven throughout the report are the community based organizations that are often at the frontlines of the work with immigrants.\nSouth Florida is at full employment. Now is the time to support and address the needs of our whole community including communities of color and the immigrant community.\nThis article was originally published on June 6, 2018 on the UnidosUS website.\nAs of this posting, Florida is the only state in the nation to not have a federally approved accountability plan.\nOn April 20, 2018, the Florida Department of Education (FDOE) submitted its revised Florida Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Plan to the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE).\nHispanic Unity of Florida is a member of a coalition of civil rights organizations that earlier this year during Florida\u2019s Legislative Session, proposed legislation that would align Florida\u2019s school accountability system with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), the largest federal law governing K-12 education. Florida\u2019s current system neglects to factor into its school grades the test scores of many English learner (EL) and Latino students, and fails to use a native language assessment when appropriate for the 10% of Florida\u2019s K-12 students who are learning English.\nEffective implementation of ESSA at the state and district level is key to ensuring that educators and ELs have the data and tools they need to become English proficient and academically successful as swiftly as possible.\nUnder ESSA, in exchange for federal funds, states must track and report the performance of subgroups of students\u2014racial and ethnic minorities, those from low-income families, ELs, and those with disabilities\u2014when assessing school performance.\nFlorida\u2019s revised ESSA plan, however, sidesteps the intent of the federal law by bundling together the lowest-performing students regardless of subgroup. That means schools that are not meeting the needs of every subgroup can still get a passing grade, and parents are not aware.\nThe revised Florida plan creates the new \u201cFederal Percent of Points Earned Index\u201d (FPPEI) of which subgroup performance and an English Language Proficiency Indicator will be components. The fact that Florida created the FPPEI is a good sign that the state recognizes its obligation to align the state\u2019s system with federal law. The FPPEI, a new section of a Florida school\u2019s report card, in effect creates a parallel accountability system. The calculation of a school\u2019s grade still does not take into account subgroup performance and English language proficiency. This decision is problematic, confusing and unnecessary.\nWhat\u2019s more, while the federal government urges states, when appropriate, to test students in their native language to better assess what they know\u2014Florida chose not to meet this requirement, despite being home to one of the nation\u2019s largest EL population.\nA recent report by UnidosUS (formerly NCLR) study highlights that Florida educates the third-largest K\u201312 EL population in the nation. ELs make up 10% of Florida\u2019s student population; nearly 290,000 students. The majority of ELs\u201475%\u2014in the state speak Spanish. According to recent Florida state assessment results, double-digit gaps exist in graduation rates and academic achievement between ELs and their non\u2013EL peers.\nAs a result of the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, it is estimated that Florida is now home to between 10,000 to 12,000 Puerto Rican students.

If so, we have a great collection of examples that will help you find the right look. Our examples focus on women who have somewhat longer hair that can be used in dramatic fashion. Here you will find a number of updo hairstyles from those close to casual to others that push the boundaries and make an unforgettable impression. The first row of examples is highlighted by the third photo which features a complicated pinned up style, yet has enough play to make it attractive. The second photo is a great example of how bangs can be used to really highlight the face while still having the rest of the hair updo pinned back. Naturally, augmenting your hair with natural decorations such as flowers can make for a great way to set your style apart. In the second row we see more classic examples of sophisticated wedding and prom updo styles. While the first example is perfect for those with very curly hair, the third and fourth are pure classic updo\u2019s perfect for more formal occasions. If you have long, thick hair, then you might want to try the example in the second photo to highlight your face. The third row is a great combination of pulled back styles along with loose, more casual feel. The second example does require some work and spray, but the results are perfect for weddings. For younger women, especially those attending the prom the first and fourth photos provide excellent examples of what can be done. For the final row we have another combination of both casual and pinned up hair that you can choose from when attending the wedding or prom. In particular, the third photo shows a dramatic style indeed.\nPortfolio 3 showcases delicate up-dos mainly for long straight hair.

So I started googling to see if there was any challenges already out there that did what I was looking for. A few that I found wasn't really what I was looking for. I wanted to also create all the rabbit hole lots along with the residential lots with out having to move into each house and leave other sims behind. I didn't want to have to repopulate the whole town with just my sim either so I decided to create my own. So here is what I have come up with so far.\nI was requested to write down the rules for this challenge so here are the challenge rules!\nYour sim has come from an over crowded town with lots of noise and pollution. They have traveled far away from any civilization and has settled here to start over from scratch. This area has no buildings, no houses and no residents. This is a great place for your sim to start over in life and build everything from scratch from the ground up.\nPick any world you like and go into Edit Town and delete every house and building. This includes any rabbit holes.\nPick your sim either by creating new or a preexisting one.\nYour lifespan can be what ever you want, I suggest a long one. I'm using a fairy so I have a very long life span.\nYour sim will not have a job to start out with so you will need to make money in other ways like fishing, searching for flowers or gems to sell.\nOnce your sim has some money you can do other things to make money as well like painting, photography, writing for example.\nOnce some job buildings are placed you can have your sim have a job along with previous mentions of money making activities.\nYour sim can buy properties or become business owners to make money as well.\n~When you build the house to rent, you don't need to build with your own money otherwise your sim will end up spending double the cost. Build the house then go in and have your sim rent it out.\n~Once a residential lot has been created for a certain category, you can add to it later as long as it doesn't take it out of it's original category; for example: a starter home changing to a family home.\nThere can be NO residents living in the town until there is a house sufficient enough for them to live.\nFor example: must have fridge, toilet, bed and shower/tub along with all flooring and wallpapers in the home as well.\nOnce there is a place for a sim to move in, you can move any sim in you want or an immigrant can move in. No Immigrants are aloud to move into any empty lots so make sure they are all set to no visitors until a residential lot is built.\nAll community and residential lots must be built by your sim.\nAll Parks must be built by your sim.\nAll active job's that need a building need to be built by your sim.\nYour sim can have any personal life you choose. Once there are residents living in your town, your sim can date, get married, have children or your sim can live alone for their entire life. However you choose.\nAny community lot can be combined with another community lot. For example, a tattoo parlor can be built with a salon. More than two can be built together which comes in handy when your not working with very many lots in the world or it's a small island. If you do not have an expansion pack that has one of the requirement builds listed above that is okay.\nYou can only fail the challenge if one thing were to happen, your sim dies before the above requirements are met.\nThere is a possibility of any of these rules changing as I go along in my video series as I have not tested out this challenge. Any ideas or suggestions or if I missed anything in the rules are welcome!\nLet me know how this challenge is going for you!\nI started a game similar to this and had to place a few community lots and my town's main library has a city hall rabbit hole rug for editing the chances of alien abductions resulting in pregnancies.I placed skill requiremnents for aditional building and they also have to build their house first before any other buildings get built in edit town.I also did require lots for new families to have a mailbox,trash bin. wall section,burglar alarm,fire alarm,sleeping bags and laptop computers though cheap ones.The founders have to get a house built before winter arrives and survive their first winter before adding to their house and they also have to start growing plants on their lot before the second winter and new families could begin arriving the following year in late spring or early summer.I allow chess tables and martial arts equipment to start showing up after a second household is in town.Building is based on donations on community lots or taxes collected from incomes.\nI made a change in the rules when it comes to building the house you want to rent out to your town."}

{"doc_id": "449", "text": "It's safe to say that the past two weeks have been the most difficult that Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and the Labour-led Government have faced.\nBetween the sexual assaults at a Young Labour summer camp, the entire Russia fiasco, Ron Mark melting down over defence force flights, Jenny Salesa's Ministerial spending, criticism that not enough was being down to help the Nelson and Tasman regions in their recovery from Cyclone Gita, the Green Party ambushing Labour by announcing they were gifting questions to National, and Shane Jones repeatedly shoving his foot in his mouth over Air New Zealand, there's a lot that's been going wrong lately.\nThe public relations triumph that was Ardern's Waitangi visit must seem like an age ago, while the successful Pacific Mission has completely vanished from view.\nDespite all that, when the next round of political polling is released I don't expect to see any significant change from what we saw in February. I'd expect to see Labour in the mid to high 40s, National in the mid to low 40s, and the Greens and New Zealand First struggling to reach 5 per cent.\nThe main reason for this is that Ardern hasn't been personally responsible for many of the issues that have played out and, where she has, they've mostly been on things that I don't think are necessarily going to sway voters. That, combined with her personal popularity, will mean that while Ardern has burnt some political capital fighting fires, she still has a deep well of support to call on.\nThe Labour Party's seemingly terrible handling of the sexual assaults at the Waihi camp will reflect badly on Labour's General Secretary Andrew Kirton, but as Ardern was only briefly at the camp delivering a speech, and had nothing to do with its organisation or the events in question, I doubt any voters will hold her responsible for it. A test may come further down the line when Labour's own internal investigation is complete if it finds significant failings on the part of the party organisation and Ardern doesn't demand that someone takes personal responsibility, but that's hard to preempt given there's a lot of water to go under the bridge.\nThe Russia fiasco - Winston Peters' alternative facts on Russian interference with the US election and Russian involvement in the downing of MH17, the bizarre focus of Peters on a Russian free trade deal, and the ham-fisted attempt by the Government to first condemn the Salisbury attack without blaming Russia, then several days later finally managing to step into line with our allies and blame Russia, as well as Ardern's bungled attempts to spin away that foreign policy disaster - while a bad look generally for Ardern and Peters, isn't the type of issue that will sway votes, even if it has lead to some questioning within the beltway of Ardern's own judgement and Peters' motives.\nWhat has been interesting is that the Russia saga played out over 11 days. If a day is a long time in politics, then 11 days is an eternity for an issue like this to run its initial course. There's possibly more to come in this space, which could start to erode voter confidence in the Government's foreign policy and security credentials.\nRon Mark's defence force flights and Jenny Salesa's ministerial spending are similarly both minor issues. In the bigger scheme of things both are relatively minor issues. While Mark hasn't handled the pressure being questioned about the flights put him under particularly well, Ardern did the requisite telling off of Salesa and unless it becomes a pattern of overspend, the matter will rest there.\nOne thing that will nag at Labour's recovery of support in the regions, at least in the top of the South Island, has been the Government's sluggish response to Cyclone Gita in Nelson and Tasman. It took nearly three weeks after Cyclone Gita hit New Zealand for the Government to announce any meaningful assistance for businesses cut off by the storm. And unlike the flooding in Edgecumbe, which prompted a Prime Ministerial visit from Bill English to see first hand what had unfolded, the residents of Takaka and the surrounding areas still haven't seen or heard from Ardern.\nNot that anyone is suggesting a Prime Minister visiting is somehow going to magically undo the damage done by a given disaster, but it usually serves as both a way to boost morale in the affected communities, as well as to highlight the ongoing importance of the recovery to Government agencies to ensure they keep their efforts up.\nThe Green Party surprising everyone by gifting questions in Question Time to National has been an interesting issue to follow the reaction to. While it feeds the Opposition's narrative that not all is well and cozy on the Government benches, any consequential reaction to it seems to be more directed at the Green Party over it, both supportive of the move and in opposition to it. While headlines of the Greens doing a deal with National aren't helpful to Labour, it seems unlikely this will translate into the polls either.\nFinally, there was Shane Jones' attack on Air New Zealand. It kicked off on Friday and didn't end until Ardern finally hauled Jones back into line during Question Time on Wednesday. Jones' comments caused some concern in both the beltway and business community, as did Ardern's initial backing of Jones. Outside of the beltway, Jones' comments will have played well.\nTowards the end of the past two weeks Ardern was getting visibly frustrated with both media questioning and Opposition attacks. In part this will stem from this being the first time her Government has been hauled over the coals for a significant length of time. But no doubt a lot of her annoyance will come from the fact that most of the problems she's been having to deal with aren't ones that she's been responsible for, barring her poor handling of the Russia issue.\nThe rough patch is set to continue too. With the Select Committee submissions soon to be heard on the Electoral Integrity Amendment Bill, there will be a stream of negative headlines about the Government pushing that Bill through, as well as the Green Party's support for it. There's also lingering questions around Winston Peters' infatuation with Putin's Russia.\nIt shouldn't escape anyone's notice that New Zealand First, who are struggling badly in polls, have been the source of three of the issues that have dogged the Government in the past two weeks. Shane Jones' comments are perhaps the most interesting in this regard, as they point towards New Zealand First taking a much more vocal stand on issues that might not always sit well with the responsibilities and requirements of occupying the Government benches.\nThe good news for Labour is that with Easter fast approaching, and beyond that the beginning of pre-Budget announcements, the Government does have an opportunity to start setting the news agenda rather than reacting to it."}

At North it shares borders with Thessaly, at West with Western Greece and at South with Attica. It is surrounded by the Aegean Sea and the Gulf of Evia at the east and by the Corinthian Gulf at the South.\nThe Region has a population of 546.870 inhabitants, corresponding to 5.07% of the total population of the country. The 33% of the population in Sterea Ellada is urban, concentrated mainly in the departments of Euvoia (210.210 inhabitants) and Fthiotitda (158.220 inhabitants), the 15% is semi-urban and the 52% is rural.\nSterea Ellada occupies a total area of 15,549 sq. km., corresponding to 11,8% of the total area of Greece and consists of 735,8 million hectares of mountain area, 497,1 million hectares of semi-mountainous area and 322,2 million hectares of lowland area. The two main islands of the Region, Evia and Skyros, are pole of tourist attraction.\nSterea Ellada is the industrial centre of Greece, nevertheless it has rural areas too. It is worth noting that only 3% of the total area is residential. The main mountainous area of Sterea Ellada is formed around its centre. Forests cover the 25% of the total regional area, while 2% is covered by water. The cultivated areas of the region occupy the 26% of total area, while the 43% is used in farming activities. The Region is rich in special and rare ecosystems; 18 special environmental sites of the Region are being protected according to the NATURA 2000 framework, while there are 3 Special Protection Areas. Sterea Ellada is famous for its world-renown hot springs and spa.\n\u03a4he share of the population that is economically active is 33%, from of which 9,4 % works in the primary sector, 51,5% in the secondary sector and 42,1 % in the tertiary sector. The unemployment rate accounts for the 16,1% of the population and lies slightly above the national average. Immigration flows have importantly affected the demography of the region, as the immigrants\u2019 share in the composition of the regional population accounts for 8%, one of the highest in Greece.\nDue to favorable conditions and because of its proximity to Attiki, the Region of Sterea Ellada has emerged as one of the industrial centres of Greece with important industrial and manufacturing activities, accounting for the 46% of the regional GDP. Moreover, activites related to the tertiary sector account for the 43% of the regional GDP and gravitate mostly real estate and public services. The tourism sector, on the other hand, counts up only for the 4,4% of the regional GDP and is less developed than the national average, however, it has great potential for further growth due to the region\u2019s natural hot springs and spa (Kamena Vourla, Edipsos), archaeological sites and geographic location.\nThe agricultural sector counts up only for the 8% percent of the regional GDP% and is estimated to be subject of further decline in the future. Rural activities concentrate in the production of olive oil, wheat, fruits and vegetables, as well as in the breeding of livestock. Numerous agricultural products of the Region have been enlisted in the Protected Designation Origin EU scheme, such as, the Olives of Stylida, Konservolia of Amfissa and Atalanti, Katiki Domokou (goat cheese), Formaela (goat cheese),Fistiki of Ftiotida and Dry Figs of Kimi. The Region interconnects North and South Greece, not only geographically, but also with major infrastructure and motorways. It is crossed by the main road and rail axes in Greece, also included in the wider European Network of Transports. The transport network of the Sterea Ellada is supported by small regional ports, straits and marinas, yet of low capacity but with potential of further development. Moreover, the location of Sterea Ellada in the centre of Greece provides great potential for the development of a strong transportation network.\nUppsala University, founded in 1477, is the oldest university in Sweden and all Nordic countries.

Created in 1881, immediately after the Liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule, it was the beginning of the modern fight against infectious and parasitic diseases in the country on the basis of the latest achievements of world science. Contributes significantly in this regard the construction and equipment of this building NCIPD with financial support from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1932-1935. Passed more than 125 years of development, won over the years large national and international reputation NCIPD today is a major national unit in the field of health collaborators who develop the scientific foundations and methodological approaches for successful control of communicable diseases - their ethion-pathogenesis , epidemiology, laboratory diagnostics, immunotherapy and specific and non-specific immunization, according to the latest achievements of science and requirements of the WHO and the European Union.\nIn this regard they have contributed very long tradition, continuity, broad international contacts and many good laboratory facilities in NCIPD, as well as high requirements for specialists working in it. All this makes today NCIPD very authoritative and respected national and international research and applied research institution. Special mention should be made of complex, multidisciplinary approach to solve all scientific and practical problems and tasks in the fight against infectious and parasitic diseases based on close cooperation of specialists from different fields: epidemiologists, microbiologists, virologists, parasitologists, immunologists, chemists, biochemists, veterinarians and others working in the National Inspectorate, which is a guarantee of success.\nProduction of certain biological products for the diagnosis, treatment and immunization."}
